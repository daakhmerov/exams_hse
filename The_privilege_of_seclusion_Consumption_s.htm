<h1 style="text-align:right;padding:0pt 0pt 78pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE CLOSED CITY OF SEVERODVINSK</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">*</span></h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:17pt;"><span class="font3">“The level of happiness was higher here than anywhere else.”<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark1">1</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;Thus a<br>young inhabitant of Severodvinsk summarized the popular narrative about<br>living under the special condition of a closed city in the late Brezhnev pe-<br>riod. After this remark, he continued, referring to the privileged recreational<br>possibilities for the citizens of Severodvinsk on the Black Sea coast: “For<br>several weeks nearly every citizen of Severodvinsk could visit the holiday<br>resort of Severodvinsk’s submarine construction plant in Evpatoria in the<br>Crimea”.<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark3">3</a></sup><sup></sup> This remark indicates both a certain feeling of being privileged<br>and mobile, despite living in a remote closed city, and a nostalgic note of<br>loss in the post-Soviet period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:17pt;"><span class="font3">It is symptomatic that the speaker refers to the realm of consumption and<br>leisure as the main indicator of “happiness.”<a name="footnote4"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">4</a></sup><sup></sup> In the first place, this remark<br>has to be located within the changed context of post-Soviet leisure and con-<br>sumption patterns, but at the same time, it still bears the notion of a signifi-<br>cant shift in consumption strategies, which characterized the post-Stalinist<br>Soviet Union.<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark5">5</a></sup><sup></sup> Under Khrushchev, consumption became one of the central<br>arguments of ideological legitimacy. Alongside the enthusiastic promotion<br>of new appliances and the provision of Soviet citizens with private apart-<br>ments where the newly emerging consumerism could be celebrated, state<br>authorities sought to regulate modes of consumption and tastes, including<br>these issues to the realm of ideology. The new openness toward the West<br>under Khrushchev allowed for more information about lifestyles beyond<br>the border and even for some direct contact with foreigners. Despite all of<br>the desperate attempts made by ideological guardians to prevent or diminish<br>the influx ofWestem culture into the Soviet Union, the 1957 International<br>Youth Festival and the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:240pt;"><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ab Imperio,</span><span class="font3"> 2/2011<br>became pivotal events, especially for urban youth, in their reassessment of<br>self-expression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">If during Khrushchev's 1950s and 1960s this phenomenon was confined<br>to quite limited urban subcultures of privileged young people who imitated<br>Western fashion, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stiliagi</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shtatniki,</span><span class="font3"> it became a mass phenomenon<br>during the following decades, when the acquisition of fashionable clothing<br>went through established black-market structures. Under Brezhnev, the<br>public attitude and policing of potential ideological disloyalty attributed<br>to the consumption of Western products became less offensive and more<br>ambivalent.<a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">6</a></sup><sup></sup> The Khrushchevian mechanisms of social control - comrade<br>courts and people's patrols - lost their enthusiastic impetus of earlier years<br>and became formalistic obligations. If </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stiliagi</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shtatniki</span><span class="font3"> in homemade<br>flashy clothing had had to suffer official persecution and public reprehen-<br>sion, fashionably dressed youngsters in jeans and T-shirts in the 1970-1980s<br>were admired as well-to-do, modem, and attractive by a large segment of<br>Soviet citizens and, as a rule, left in peace by the authorities. The emer-<br>gence of a widespread semilegal black market for Western items and the<br>consumption practices attached to it attest to a changed mode of interac-<br>tion between the state authorities and Soviet citizens. A significant shift<br>occurred toward what can be called a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">flexible socialism</span><span class="font3"> that allowed for a<br>new quality of negotiation with the authorities in pursuing personal interests<br>and needs. This shift is often described in research on the post-Stalinist<br>and late Soviet eras as a change that tackled the preeminence of the public<br>or official spheres in the lives of ordinary citizens, freed them to a certain<br>degree from the social pressure of previous decades, and strengthened the<br>realm of privacy.<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark7">7</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">To a large extent, this research focuses on consumption as a practice<br>that formed private spheres.<a name="footnote8"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">8</a></sup><sup></sup> At the present stage, the argument about the<br>changed relationship of the public, official, and private spheres oscillates<br>between two general positions: One follows the so-called binary description<br>of late Soviet society through oppositions of state and people, oppression and</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font3">resistance, truth and lie, and the formula of &quot;double-think'’ as the dominant<br>behavior pattern of ordinary Soviet people as a pragmatic reaction to the<br>inherent contradictions of the Soviet system. Oleg Kharkhordin has argued<br>that, as in the post-Stalin Soviet Union, state control became both more<br>discrete and omnipresent, the realm of &quot;privacy&quot; could only be protected<br>by dissimulation.<a name="footnote9"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">9</a></sup><sup></sup> This model implies an antagonistic relationship between<br>two firm, clearly defined spheres, and the split in an individual who changes<br>his/her behavior according to the sphere and is also aware of contradictions<br>and antagonisms between the two realms. Boris Dubin has developed a<br>similar approach to the issue of public and private, arguing for a kind of<br>&quot;schizophrenic&quot; behavior of Homo Sovieticus in late Socialism, which was<br>guided by &quot;double-think&quot; and &quot;double-speak.”<a name="footnote10"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark10">10</a></sup><sup></sup> Vladimir Shlapentokh, in his<br>analysis of the process of &quot;privatization” in the post-Stalinist Soviet Union,<br>sees less antagonistic, but still clearly discernible spheres of behavior in<br>private and public.<a name="footnote11"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark11">11</a></sup><sup></sup>&quot; Ingrid Owald and Viktor Voronkov have modified the<br>binary model of private versus public into a triple model that includes official,<br>public-private, and private spheres, and allows for a certain porousness of<br>these spheres, but at the same time emphasizes the &quot;social schizophrenia” of<br>Soviet citizens.<a name="footnote12"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark12">12</a></sup><sup></sup> These models are based on liberal concepts of a pragmatic<br>self that perceive the paradoxes of the Soviet system as such and seek ways<br>to accommodate to them.<a name="footnote13"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark13">13</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font3">While still popular in current research,<a name="footnote14"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">14</a></sup><sup></sup> these notions - the binary<br>conceptualization of late Soviet society that consisted of dissimulating<br>citizens - have recently been questioned.<a name="footnote15"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">15</a></sup><sup></sup> The most radical challenge was<br>articulated by Sergei Oushakine and Alexei Yurchak.<a name="footnote16"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">16</a></sup><sup></sup> Applying discourse<br>and performance theory, they argued for the failure of binary models to<br>approach the Soviet experience due to the Western, liberal origin of these<br>concepts and the general Cold War context of the debate. Instead, Yurchak<br>focuses on a &quot;performative shift” in the daily practices of Soviet people,<br>which originated in the disappearance of primary ideological meaning in<br>official discourses and rituals. It was the performative act itself, according<br>to Yurchak, that maintained social stability and enabled the simultaneous<br>creation of new meanings of official rituals. Yurchak offers, therefore, an<br>interpretation of late Soviet experience that transgresses binary oppositions<br>and sees a position &quot;vnye'' </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(yne,</span><span class="font3"> literally, &quot;outside'') - beyond enthusiastic<br>commitment and opposition as the dominant and characteristic pattern<br>of the epoch.<a name="footnote17"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">17</a></sup><sup></sup> Kevin F.M. Platt and Benjamin Nathans have challenged<br>Yurchak for his overly simplistic analysis of dissident culture and for ne-<br>glecting the subversive potential of what he sees as an apolitical position<br>&quot;vne.” Platt and Nathans reintroduce to a certain extent binary opposition<br>and dissimulative behavior. Their argument focuses on political energy<br>that was concealed in the allegedly apolitical position of ordinary Soviet<br>citizens.<a name="footnote18"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark18">18</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">Despite significant differences, these interpretations of late Soviet society<br>try to grasp what was called a &quot;little deal,’’<a name="footnote19"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark19">19</a></sup><sup></sup> an &quot;organized consensus,’’<a name="footnote20"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark20">20</a></sup><sup></sup> a<br>&quot;transitional [era of] de-Stalinization and re-Stalinization,”<a name="footnote21"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark21">21</a></sup><sup></sup> a &quot;stable modus<br>vivendi”<a name="footnote22"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark22">22</a></sup><sup></sup>: the quality of social stability in late Soviet society under Brezhnev.<br>The problem with assessing these interpretations is twofold: They differ in<br>the notion of private sphere, and there is no consensus on the periodization<br>of post-Stalin Soviet history either.<a name="footnote23"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark23">23</a></sup><sup></sup> In general, the clear-cut opposition of<br>public and private draws on Western liberal thinking that claims universality,<br>but reproduces a theoretical condition rather than an empirically corroborated<br>historical experience and practice.<a name="footnote24"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark24">24</a></sup><sup></sup> To grasp the experience of Soviet people<br>within complex networks by an opposition of public and private becomes<br>even more difficult, as there is no exact discursive equivalent to these no-<br>tions.<a name="footnote25"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark25">25</a></sup><sup></sup> The Russian &quot;obshchestvennoe” (public), &quot;publichnoc&quot; (social),<br>&quot;chastnoc&quot; (private), and &quot;lichnoc&quot; (personal) differ in their connotations<br>from their counterparts in West European languages. To move away from the<br>opposition of private vs. public, here I use the term &quot;personal&quot; to denote a<br>focal point of social networks, group solidarities of various kinds and sizes,<br>of interests, aspirations, desires, and tastes in which a person is embedded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">This article continues the discussion of the quality of social stability in<br>the late Soviet Union by examining people's behavior within the complex<br>net of social boundaries of the Brezhnevite society in the special case of<br>the closed city of Severodvinsk. The argument focuses in particular on the<br>negotiation of personal interests vis-a-vis social structures and the state au-<br>thorities by consumption practices. In what follows, I stress the situational<br>character of such negotiations. The argument is based on the assumption<br>that in everyday practice it was the situational setting that decided the limits<br>of the personal.<a name="footnote26"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark26">26</a></sup><sup></sup> This approach does not exclude a priori the antagonism<br>of personal and public/official and a possibility for dissimulative behavior,<br>but considers &quot;double-speak” as just one possible pattern within the variety<br>of &quot;flexi-speak.”<a name="footnote27"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">27</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>

The question is what<br>kind of commitment was at stake here and how was it performed? The other<br>issue concerns the level or extent of negotiations between citizens and of-<br>ficialdom - was there less space for negotiation or more? What were the<br>intended and unintended consequences of these special conditions?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">Focusing on three case studies that address modes of consumption in<br>late-Brezhnev Severodvinsk, I argue that in particular situations the city's<br>very structure and condition facilitated and produced new possibilities for<br>pursuing personal goals that transgressed ideological and spatial seclusion.<br>But at the same time, the realm of personal interests could only expand<br>through negotiation with the state structure, not in resistance to it.<a name="footnote29"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark29">29</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;text-indent:48pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Severodvinsk within the spatial hierarchy of the Soviet Union</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font3">With the introduction of internal passports in 1932 and a rigid registra-<br>tion system for large cities, the Soviet leadership tried to gain control over<br>migration from rural areas and simultaneously contributed to the spatial<br>segregation of Soviet society. Since that time, one's residence laigely decided<br>one's place in the social structure. Major central cities offered the highest<br>living standards with the best available earning and consumption possibili-<br>ties. At the bottom of the spatial hierarchy was the Soviet village with its<br>almost complete lack of all such facilities. With the 1956 introduction of new<br>restrictions on the growth of large cities, the policy of territorial stratifica-<br>tion that implied the closing of large cities to internal migrants became one<br>of the central pillars of the Soviet social contract.<a name="footnote30"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark31">30</a></sup><sup></sup> A system of temporary<br>and permanent incentives had to manage the labor, living, and consumption<br>markets. Special cases of this policy were the closed cities and settlements<br>in a narrow sense, as sites of military objects and strategic weapon produc-<br>tion.<a name="footnote31"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark32">31</a></sup><sup></sup> These cities either emerged from scratch in remote areas (such as most<br>nuclear cities) or already existing cities were closed to unauthorized Soviet<br>and foreign visitors with the introduction of strategic weapons production<br>in local plants. The two categories of closed cities, established by Minatom<br>(the Ministry of Nuclear Energy) and Minoborony (the Ministry of Defense),<br>differed in their regulation of internal life and level of isolation. With the<br>beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet culture of secrecy received a new<br>boost.<a name="footnote32"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark33">32</a></sup><sup></sup> The closed cities disappeared from official maps and discourse, and<br>an extremely rigid control system was introduced, especially for the secret<br>nuclear cities. The cities of Minatom were surrounded by barbed-wire fences<br>and protected by soldiers. Migrants to these cities were subject to an intensive<br>screening process by State Security, and migration from these places was<br>also highly restricted.<a name="footnote33"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark34">33</a></sup><sup></sup> Another group of closed cities constituted centers of<br>scientific research, &quot;academic cities” that were only closed to foreigners.<a name="footnote34"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark35">34</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">Severodvinsk became the site of submarine construction in 1953 and<br>from 1955 on was the center of nuclear submarine construction. As a unit<br>within the structure of the Ministry of Defense, the city was subsequently</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:241pt;"><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ab Imperio,</span><span class="font3"> 2/2011<br>closed to foreigners, and with the resolution of the Council of Ministers of<br>July 27, 1972, the city received the status of a border area and was closed<br>to Soviet citizens who lacked special entry permission.<a name="footnote35"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark36">35</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">The level of isolation here was less than in the nuclear cities of Minatom,<br>but greater than in semiclosed settlements such as the Siberian city of sci-<br>ence, Akademgorodok. Rather, there were several &quot;forbidden zones.&quot; highly<br>protected by wire, with different levels of access for authorized people.<a name="footnote36"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark37">36</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">The usual way to reach the city after 1972 was by flight to Arkhangelsk,<br>a seaport thirty kilometers from Severodvinsk, and by regional bus or car.<br>At the checkpoint five kilometers outside the city, military personal checked<br>all passengers' passports and their special permits. Unlike the secret nuclear<br>cities, Severodvinsk was not protected by a barbed-wire fence, but without<br>a permit nobody was officially allowed to enter the city. Without a permit<br>it was even impossible to by a bus ticket to Severodvinsk in Arkhangelsk.<a name="footnote37"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark38">37</a></sup><sup><br></sup>This special permission was also needed for direct train tickets. As a rule,<br>permits were given for work purposes or family reasons. For the population<br>of the surrounding area, Severodvinsk was a great shopping attraction due<br>to a significantly better supply of commodities and victuals. People from<br>neighboring settlements thus found ways to circumvent permit regulations<br>by getting private invitations from Severodvinsk residents.<a name="footnote38"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark39">38</a></sup><sup></sup> In fact, it was<br>possible to bypass the checkpoint, but only residents of Severodvinsk were<br>aware of this practice.<a name="footnote39"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark40">39</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">In the mid-1950s, Severodvinsk became the center of nuclear submarine<br>production with the city-forming leading plant Sevmash, which assured<br>its residents a standard of living higher than that in the rest of the area.<a name="footnote40"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark41">40</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font3">The legacy of the camps of Molotovsk (this was the name of the city until<br>1957) had already disappeared from the cityscape some years earlier<sup>4</sup>'<sup>1</sup> and<br>gradually from the memory of its citizens too. The city's new image became<br>associated with a project of vibrant industrial modernity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">The population grew from 100,623 inhabitants in 1962 to 197,232 in<br>1979,<a name="footnote41"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark42">41</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote42"></a><a href="#bookmark43">42</a></sup>&nbsp;and the influx was mainly composed of a freshly recruited labor<br>force: new engineering specialists and the military.<a name="footnote43"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark44">43</a></sup><sup></sup> The percentage of<br>young people between the ages of twenty and thirty-five was thus extremely<br>high. They were the ones most successfully addressed by the Soviet pro-<br>paganda of the cult of technique and romantic self-sacrificing work.<a name="footnote44"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark45">44</a></sup><sup></sup> The<br>romanticism and heroism of everyday life, extreme exposure to advanced<br>technology, and the conquest of new horizons and depths of the planet<br>were the key aspects of the Soviet patriotic myth, which assured people<br>working for the military-industrial complex, especially those in closed cit-<br>ies, a place of honor in Soviet society. But apart from enthusiastic appeals<br>to the romantic feelings of young people, material incentives for Soviet<br>citizens from all over the country significantly facilitated the recruitment<br>of workers for Severodvinsk. By the 1940s (beginning December 1, 1945),<br>the city-forming plant Sevmash (by that time plant no. 402) became the<br>bonus of the Far North. This allowed the administration to calculate higher<br>salaries using the &quot;Far North coefficient.'’<a name="footnote45"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark46">45</a></sup><sup></sup> The Far North regulations were<br>renewed in 1960 and provided all citizens of Severodvinsk with significant<br>additional benefits: 10 percent of their salary after the first year working in<br>the city with an increase of 10 percent annually, an additional eighteen-day<br>holiday, and better retirement benefits (one year of work counted as 1.5<br>years).<a name="footnote46"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark47">46</a></sup><sup></sup> Another important privilege concerned housing: after two or three<br>years of work at Sevmash, specialists could expect to move into a modem<br>apartment with all facilities. Those five- and nine-story apartment blocks,<br>built during the late 1970s, even received a special name: &quot;Severodvinsk<br>type” (Severodvinskaia seriia).<a name="footnote47"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark48">47</a></sup><sup></sup> At that time, moving into a modem apart-<br>ment in a central city such as Leningrad would usually take ten to fifteen<br>years.<a name="footnote48"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark49">48</a></sup><sup></sup> Realistic prospects of acquiring separate housing were one of the<br>main arguments for attracting young specialists, who were, in general,<br>privileged over workers.<a name="footnote49"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark50">49</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">Material benefits structured Severodvinsk society into the privileged<br>&quot;zavodskic&quot; (plant worker) and the underprivileged &quot;gorodskic&quot; (city dwell-<br>ers) who were excluded from some significant privileges of Sevmash. The<br>average salary in the city was significantly lower than at the plant: In 1960,<br>the average salary in the city amounted to 102 rubles, while at Sevmash it<br>was 157 rubles. Toward the 1980s, however, the gap in salary was smaller:<br>a city worker earned 293 rubles and Sevmash employees—366 rubles. In<br>any case, the underprivileged city workers had higher salaries than workers<br>in the surrounding area and in the country in general: In 1960, 102 rubles in<br>Severodvinsk, 90 rubles in the Arkhangelsk region, and 83.1 rubles in the<br>USSR; in 1980, 293 rubles in Severodvinsk, 224 rubles in the Arkhangelsk<br>region, and 174 rubles in the USSR.<a name="footnote50"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark51">50</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote51"></a><a href="#bookmark52">51</a></sup>&nbsp;The division between Sevmash work-<br>ers and the rest of the Severodvinsk population was manifest in the issue of<br>housing, too. The prospects of acquiring a modem comfortable apartment<br>relatively soon did not apply to employees outside Sevmash: the calculation<br>of the authorities was simple - the majority of workers outside the plant<br>originated from the surrounding area and it was unlikely that they would<br>leave the city because of the housing issue. It was obviously different with<br>the freshly recruited young specialists from other distant areas. The gap in<br>privileges between the &quot;locals'’ and the professionals recruited from outside<br>was also apparent within the plant itself: the &quot;locals&quot; were the last to get<br>an apartment.<sup>511</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">During the 1960s, improved infrastructure with public transport, cinemas,<br>theaters, cultural facilities, and shopping possibilities replaced the camp-<br>like settlement with extremely severe living and working conditions in the<br>1930s and 1940s. While the general supply of victuals improved only in<br>the mid-1960s, laterthere were additional shortages.<a name="footnote52"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark53">52</a></sup><sup></sup> Nevertheless, even to<br>visitors from Leningrad, the city appeared to be better supplied. A scholar<br>from Leningrad State Forest-Technical Academy, who first introduced live<br>plants on nuclear submarines, tried bananas - a symbol of luxury and privi-<br>lege - in Severodvinsk in the late Brezhnev period.<a name="footnote53"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark54">53</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">It is difficult to assess the exact level of material benefits of Severodvinsk<br>residents, but the general picture suggests that even if the imagined privileges<br>were greater than the actual ones, they were still enough to produce a certain<br>feeling of pride in the included and envy in the excluded.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">Sevmashvtuz, the abbreviation for the High Technical School at the<br>shipbuilding plant for submarines, the Northern Machine-building Enter-<br>prise, was a magical word for many Severodvinsk youngsters - a place for<br>social advancement, but not only in an official sense: material incentives<br>and infrastructural benefits enabled Sevmashvtuz students to make a profit<br>outside the realm of legal socialist earning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">Despite the rapid development of the city since the late 1950s, the edu-<br>cational infrastructure of Severodvinsk remained quite limited for many<br>years with only a few technical schools.<a name="footnote54"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark56">54</a></sup><sup></sup> It was only in 1965 that the first,<br>and up to now, the main institution of higher education opened: the Sev-<br>mashvtuz - High Technical School at the Sevmash plant, as an affiliated<br>institute of the Leningrad shipbuilding higher education school. The main<br>shipbuilding plant needed a well-educated technical elite raised within the<br>walls of the enterprise. Students could attend classes in full-time, part-time,<br>and &quot;extramural'’ departments.<a name="footnote55"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark57">55</a></sup><sup></sup> Most of the students were registered with<br>the full-time department and studied in the so-called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">zavod-vtuz</span><span class="font3"> method.<br>This meant that they simultaneously studied and worked in the plant.<a name="footnote56"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark58">56</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">Like other Sevmash workers who profited from social benefits and higher<br>salaries,<a name="footnote57"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark59">57</a></sup><sup></sup> the students also had special privileges in comparison with stu-<br>dents in other cities: Besides a salary they received substantial scholarships.<br>While the regular scholarship at universities and other institutions of higher<br>education amounted to 40 rubles per month, Sevmazhvtuz students received<br>more than 100 rubles. This was a significant difference that allowed them<br>to afford much more than their peers, and it is not surprising that other stu-<br>dents from Severodvinsk (who studied, for example, in Arkhangelsk) were<br>quite envious and perceived them as &quot;well-to-do'’ people.<a name="footnote58"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">58</a></sup><sup></sup> Those from<br>Sevmashvtuz could even afford to fly to Leningrad for the weekend (the<br>ticket from Arkhangelsk to Leningrad was about 14 rubles in the early 1980s,<br>and with the student discount -7 rubles). In fact, some went to Leningrad<br>and from there further to Tallinn - not only for weekend entertainment but<br>also to profit from their privileged financial situation, namely, to trade on<br>the black market.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">Despite all the controls of a closed city and the rigid security measures<br>at Sevmash, its own students could obviously participate in officially illegal<br>black-market activities. This is especially surprising as all students had a<br>certain level of access to secret documentation: the director of Sevmash<br>was simultaneously the rector of VTUZ. The topics of the students' theses<br>were directly connected to Sevmash's production, and subject to security<br>regulations. Therefore, students were allowed to work on their theses only<br>at school.<a name="footnote59"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark61">59</a></sup><sup></sup> Most likely, as in every other area, the black-market exchange<br>in Severodvinsk was semi-illegal.<a name="footnote60"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark62">60</a></sup><sup></sup> Sevmashvtuz students mixed with<br>traders at Gostinka, the space in front of and around the largest department<br>store on Nevsky Prospekt, Gostiny dvor, also the central meeting point for<br>Leningrad's special black-market profiteers </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fartsovshchiki).</span><span class="font3"> and acquired<br>highly demanded Western clothing to sell in Severodvinsk for additional<br>profit: the most popular items in the early 1980s were white, winter sport<br>shoes and down-filled jackets that were not sold in the regular shops.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font3">The state structure, in particular, enabled Sevmashvtuz students to<br>earn additional money on the black market and to encounter ideologically<br>&quot;suspect” Western goods: they had sufficient financial means and networks<br>through their school to Leningrad students. Their geographical mobility bears<br>a quality of informal social mobility too: in Severodvinsk they were admired<br>as elite by their peers who had no access to either channel: high scholar-<br>ships or connections to Leningrad. Their share in selling Western clothes<br>in Severodvinsk was not even challenged by the seaport of Archangelsk,<br>which was only thirty-five kilometers away and where seamen sold Western<br>clothes and other items on a quite large scale in a designated area of the flea<br>market that was known to everyone. But according to some contemporaries,<br>clothes on the black market of Archangelsk were not nearly as trendy as<br>those brought by students from Leningrad's Gostinka.<sup>6</sup>&quot; The students of<br>Sevmashvtuz also traded in vinyl recordings, but the main supplier was a<br>plant worker, a foreman, who went to Leningrad on weekends and invited<br>potential buyers to his apartment. To be sure, this person, a passionate mu-<br>sic fan, was an exception among the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fartsovshchiki</span><span class="font3">. The VTUZ students<br>were not the only privileged group that could participate in such activities.<br>Musicians who earned good money at the local restaurants were also active<br></span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fartsovshchiki</span><span class="font3">,<a name="footnote61"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark63">61</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote62"></a><a href="#bookmark64">62</a></sup>&nbsp;It is difficult to estimate the percentage of Severodvinsk's<br>population that participated in these activities; some population segments<br>were not aware of them at all.<a name="footnote63"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark65">63</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;padding:0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">In general, the phenomenon of the black market was nothing special for<br>the Brezhnevian Soviet society: it was a fully established sector of economic<br>and social life. The peculiarity here is the status of a closed city, which<br>enabled the citizens to participate in it but also precluded the establishment<br>of a particular space for it within the cityscape: Different from neighboring<br>Arkhangelsk or central cities, there was no special place in the city desig-<br>nated for these activities - they had to be secluded in the semiprivacy of<br>the living space. But at the same time, the activities were tolerated by the<br>security authorities, who were nevertheless well informed about the black-<br>market trade in the city through their professional and personal networks.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:right;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 75pt;"><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Case II: Negotiating the limits of private:<br>Direct contacts with Western tourists and KGB officials</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;padding:0pt 0pt 4pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">The attraction of what Alexei Yurchak called the &quot;Imaginary West&quot;<a name="footnote64"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark67">64</a></sup><sup><br></sup>was as great for young people in Severodvinsk as everywhere else in the<br>late Brezhnev period. Given the status of the city as a closed settlement<br>with secret strategic production it was impossible for Severodvinsk youth<br>to meet</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">foreigners</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">in</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">the</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">city.</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">Nevertheless, some could find their way to<br>making friends with foreign tourists - despite secrecy regulations - via<br>directly negotiating the limits of seclusion with the authorities, as the case<br>of one student from Severodvinsk demonstrates.<a name="footnote65"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark68">65</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote66"></a><a href="#bookmark69">66</a></sup>&nbsp;While studying English<br>at the Pedagogical High School in Arkhangelsk, he continued to live in<br>Severodvinsk and commuted for his studies. His desire to meet a foreigner<br>personally arose not only from the general context of contemporary youth<br>culture, but in particular from his educational background:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 24pt;"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">...'A</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> H3V<sup>L</sup>ia.l aHr.lHHCKHH S3BIK, MHC XOTC.lOCb npaKTHKH. H BOoSlUC<br>XOTCJIOCb B MH]3 0KH0 npOpv6l4Tb. H IIllTep jaBa.1 3TH B03M0&gt;KH0CTH. '<sup>,S</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font3">For him, as a student of English, to come into personal contact with an English-<br>speaking foreigner and to get firsthand information about the West was in<br>general easier than for the non-English-speaking mass of his peers. On the<br>other hand, his residence background - registration in closed Severodvinsk -<br>was an obstacle. It was possible to meet a foreigner in Arkhangelsk in the early<br>1980s through the so-called Interclub for foreign sailors, which the majority of<br>female English students in Arkhangelsk did. But there, one was always under<br>the observation of KGB officers.<a name="footnote67"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark70">67</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote68"></a><a href="#bookmark71">68</a></sup>&nbsp;It was quite popular among young people<br>of that period to meet Western tourists in central cities such as Leningrad at<br>theaters or museums, especially at the Hermitage. For example, the student<br>of English was familiar with Leningrad from his vacations, and managed to<br>meet several Western tourists. They drank vodka together and some of the<br>tourists gave out their postal addresses. This is an ordinary story so far. But<br>probably unlike the majority of young people from Leningrad or other large<br>cities, those from Severodvinsk had to adjust their behavior to the status of<br>the city: contacts with foreigners were a very critical, but also exotic issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;padding:0pt 0pt 4pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">Caught in this dilemma, the student decided to try. Before writing to<br>a new friend abroad, he sought permission from the local KGB division.<br>He went to the KGB officials out of fear of writing from a closed city to a<br>foreign person, as he explained it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 4pt 24pt;"><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FI pcLun.3. TaM CHauajia mhc CTpaniHO dbuio, Hy 3ai&lt;pbiTbiH ropoj<br>TaM, a norneji b Hamy KarcdcuiKv u npauo bot TaK roBopjo: bot iyT y<br>MCH3I HHOCTpaHCU. X0T6JI 5bl CO MH011 nCpCnHCblBaTbCH.'’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font3">It is obvious from the student's presentation of the situation to a KGB official<br>that he was trying to modify the situation, to downplay his eager interest<br>in Western culture, and to present himself as merely being responsive to<br>the foreigner's interest. But it would be going too far to see in this move a<br>complete change of behavior, a kind of &quot;double-speak.&quot; It is useful here to<br>focus on the situational setting and the quality of networking in which the<br>student is engaged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 2pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">He was subsequently granted verbal permission, but with the warning<br>that he would probably face difficulties later, after finishing his studies, in<br>acquiring a good job position. The obvious message was that it is not com-<br>pletely forbidden, but not desirable either:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 4pt 23pt;"><span class="font3">Ну это ваше дело, ваше право... пожалуйста, но потом... рас-<br>пределение там и прочее-прочее, мы ничего не гарантируем... то<br>есть намекнули так, что можно, но не желательно. Я так плюнул<br>на все, думаю, будь что будет.<sup>08</sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 2pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">The student of English received the letters from abroad without any<br>further problems, but was periodically summoned to the KGB division,<br>questioned, and required to summarize the content: the main topics were<br>family and music. The most sensitive point was, of course, information<br>about the Sevmash plant and the production of submarines, which was not<br>to be mentioned in his letters at all. And as long as he complied with these<br>requirements, he could easily continue his exchange of letters with foreign-<br>ers . He did not concern himself much about whether his letters were checked<br>by the KGB, but assumed they probably were. In the course of meetings at<br>the KGB office, he always met with the same person as on his first visit and<br>formed a sort of personal contact with this official, whom he would later<br>characterize as a decent person:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 23pt;"><span class="font3">Человека, с которым я потом встречался много раз потом, ко-<br>торый работал в органах, он даже живет сейчас до сих пор рядом<br>со мной, мы здороваемся постоянно, ...я даже не знаю, просто<br>может быть, потому что люди были такие более или менее ин-<br>теллигентные, приличные, когда работали, и из-за этого никаких<br>проблем не было... ,°<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2"><sup>68</sup> Ibid. “Well, this is your business, you have the right to do this... so go ahead, but after-<br>wards ... there will be job placement and the like, and we cannot guarantee anything...<br>So, they hinted that it was allowed but undesirable. I did not give a damn about this, I<br>decided to let it be...”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;"><span class="font2"><sup>69</sup> Ibid. “Since then I’ve met this man who worked in the KGB many times, he even lives<br>not far from me and we always greet each other,... -1 do not know why; maybe because</span></p></li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font3">How should we assess the kind of relationship this student formed with<br>the KGB officer? And what can this story teach us about negotiating personal<br>interests under the special conditions of a closed city?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font3">The relationship between the KGB official and this ordinary resident of<br>Severodvinsk with no access to secret information appeared to be normal<br>and rather relaxed. Officials were obviously not seriously concerned about<br>the case, as the student had no access to plant and state secrets, but neverthe-<br>less wanted to have the situation under their control, in order to answer to<br>those above them and secure their own jobs. In this case, the officials and<br>the student who was so interested in Western goods and lifestyle could easily<br>find a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modus vivendi,</span><span class="font3"> as neither side questioned the legitimacy of the other<br>and was inclined more toward cooperation than confrontation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font3">Relations between state officials and youth interested in Western culture<br>were not always as smooth as in this case. Pornographic films (or films<br>perceived by the authorities as such) from the West were clearly limited in<br>terms of what was permitted, but the outcome of prosecution was subject<br>to negotiation too. In the mid-1970s a person was sentenced for three years<br>and all of the equipment (the TV, recorder, and tapes) was confiscated. In<br>the early 1980s, a group of friends who were all involved in black-market<br>activities met in a private apartment to watch Tinto Brass's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caligula</span><span class="font3"> (1979),<br>a controversial film classified as pornographic even by some Western au-<br>thorities. After it became known to state security, they were all summoned<br>to the KGB office and threatened with sentencing, but left in peace after<br>the intervention of a senior official on behalf of one of the accused who<br>was his friend.<sup>7</sup>&quot;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font3">Although the case of the English-language student cannot be general-<br>ized, there are some striking parallels with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caligula</span><span class="font3"> case, which enable<br>us to have a closer look at social networking and the entanglement of the<br>personal and the social/official. These cases do not allow a clear delinea-<br>tion of hermetic spheres of the personal vis-a-vis state authorities, but at<br>the same time, it is possible for a person to pursue and articulate personal<br>interest only in cooperation with the state by building personal relations<br>with its representatives. As to the issue of &quot;double-speak,'’ in the case of <a name="footnote69"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark72">69</a></sup><sup></sup><br>the English-language student, it is difficult to trace a kind of dissimulation<br>or the split of a person into a &quot;true intimate self’ and an &quot;official self’: He<br>does not exclude his role as the resident of a closed city from his personal<br>engagement with Western culture. But, at the same time, his cooperation<br>with state security does not mean that he is totally exposed to state authority<br>or is hiding his &quot;true self’ behind a mask. What is particularly significant<br>is the open outcome of the negotiation and the commitment on both sides<br>to cooperation and networking.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">The quality of the social networks of Severodvinsk illustrated in this<br>particular case seems to partially confirm the research suggesting that nuclear<br>closed cities are communities bound by fear and submission.<a name="footnote70"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark73">70</a></sup><sup></sup> Fear was the<br>student's initial motivation for contacting the authorities. On the other hand,<br>the student succeeded in pursuing his private interest in Western culture<br>and personal contact with a Western person. As both cases demonstrate, it<br>was the special mode of interaction with the authorities - the importance of<br>face-to-face everyday contact with KGB officials, who may live next door or<br>be close friends - that enabled the student to transgress to a certain degree<br>the limits of the permissible or allowed the others to escape prosecution.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:right;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 92pt;"><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Case III: Maintaining stability:<br>Discotheques, informal networks, summer holidays</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">A relatively stable </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modus vivendi</span><span class="font3"> between state officials and students<br>also embraced other areas of cultural consumption and leisure: student<br>parties at the VTUZ dormitories. Leisure activities were of course quite<br>limited in comparison to Leningrad or even Arkhangelsk, but nevertheless,<br>the prominent discotheques at the VTUZ dormitories could impress even<br>students from neighboring Arkhangelsk, and in two ways - again an openly<br>privileged material status and a somewhat &quot;privileged” relationship with the<br>authorities. Every block of dormitories had a coffee bar on the ground floor<br>that became a dance floor for student discotheques in the evenings. Students<br>from Arkhangelsk attending one of these parties in the dormitories were es-<br>pecially surprised about two aspects: first, that Severodvinsk students could<br>freely consume alcohol sitting at the windows while the rest were dancing,<br>and, second, that almost all of those openly consuming alcohol held their own<br>bottles of vodka, but no police were seen preventing this or even present.<a name="footnote71"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark75">71</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">These retrospective reminiscences must obviously be taken with caution.<br>The police were quite alert in Severodvinsk during that period and the local<br>party leaders were very enthusiastic about every initiative from the Central<br>Committee.<a name="footnote72"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark76">72</a></sup><sup></sup> Furthermore, the perceived high standards of living and con-<br>sumption possibilities as well as &quot;good'’ relations with officials have to be<br>seen in relation to the status and image of the city as a trouble-free place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">To be sure, the supply of general victuals and even some special products<br>(wine, fish, smoked sausages) was in fact better than in the surrounding<br>peripheral area (so that there was an exchange of general victuals through<br>personal networks) and to a certain degree even better than in Leningrad,<br>due to both easier planning for a small city and priority status. But regarding<br>other consumer goods such as clothing or furniture, the situation was not<br>much better than everywhere else. And the inhabitants of Severodvinsk had to<br>find their way through the notorious blat (bribe) network. Some people used<br>the channel of restaurants on long-distance trains between Severodvinsk and<br>Moscow. Apparently it was possible to contact staff on these trains and to<br>arrange networking: some ordered deficit food (caviar, special sausages, bet-<br>ter wine), others much desired imported women's shoes or other clothing.<a name="footnote73"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark77">73</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font3">So, even those inhabitants of Severodvinsk who were geographically less<br>mobile than, for example, the Sevmashvtuz students, could still find other<br>ways to acquire desired goods.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">Social welfare at the Sevmash plant contributed much to both the stabil-<br>ity and mobility of its workers - as was the case with the aforementioned<br>vacations on the Black Sea coast. It enabled inhabitants of Severodvinsk not<br>only to use Sevmash's own facilities in the Crimea (in Yalta and Evpatoria)<a name="footnote74"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark78">74</a></sup><sup><br></sup>but also to spend some summer weeks at the seaside as &quot;wild&quot; tourists.<a name="footnote75"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark79">75</a></sup><sup><br></sup>Young people (such as students), in particular, were able to earn some<br>money as pioneer leaders at the summer camps of Sevmash in Evpatoria.<br>Even the citizens of Severodvinsk who did not work at Sevmash could<br>still</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">gain</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">access</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">to</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">privileged</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font3">resorts through kinship and other kinds of<br>networks.<a name="footnote76"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark80">76</a></sup><sup></sup> The possibility of spending some time in the Crimea was gener-<br>ally highly valued in Soviet society and could be designated to an outsider<br>not only as a privilege and an object of pride but also as something that<br>maintained the coherence and stability of the community.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:right;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;"><span class="font3">Regarding Soviet society in the post-Stalin era in general, Stephen Lovell<br>has stated it &quot;was mobile, and it increasingly moved on its own terms rather<br>than those of the state.'’<a name="footnote77"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark82">77</a></sup><sup></sup> In concentrated form, this can also be observed<br>about the closed city of Severodvinsk. Encounters with Western goods and<br>people were possible even for the citizens of this closed city. But I would<br>add that while in Severodvinsk the society moved, it was the configuration<br>of special state structures and specific quality of local networks that enabled<br>the movement. The geographical and social mobility of Severodvinsk's<br>inhabitants was made possible through the state structure and welfare. The<br>ambivalence of privilege and subjection manifested in the status of a closed<br>city and personal networks in a secluded community enabled people to<br>negotiate their personal interests in particular situations. A special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modus<br>vivendi</span><span class="font3"> between individual citizens of Severodvinsk or particular groups<br>such as students and state authorities rested largely on personal networks,<br>which contributed much to maintaining coherence and stability, attenuating<br>ideological and spatial restrictions, and absorbing conflicts.</span></p>
