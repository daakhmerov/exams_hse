<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What Was “Reform Communism”?</span></h2>
<p class="font16">Communists never used the notion of <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">reform communism.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">From World War I, their identity was built in opposition to </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">revisionist</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">tendencies&nbsp;among the socialist parties. They used the term </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">reformism</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">as a negative&nbsp;label and a synonym of right-wing </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">degeneration.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Right up to </span><span class="font2">1989 </span><span class="font16">their&nbsp;political culture upheld Marxist revolutionary references as a way to differentiate themselves from social democracy. Nevertheless, the lexicon and&nbsp;practices of a reform approach did emerge in the communist world after&nbsp;the death of Stalin. In the Soviet Union and in Europe, de-Stalinization and&nbsp;</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">peaceful coexistence</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">implied a change that could be interpreted in different&nbsp;ways, but clearly leaned toward gradualism and nonviolent transformation&nbsp;more than revolutionary thrusts. Although far-reaching ideas of reform were&nbsp;rapidly shelved, prospects of peaceful change still left their trace among&nbsp;communists, and ideas inspired by </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialist humanism</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">did not simply&nbsp;disappear.</span></p>
<p class="font16">This legacy was most evident among the Czechoslovak reformers who led the Prague Spring of <span class="font2">1968</span><span class="font16">, which would rapidly turn into a founding myth for&nbsp;</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialism with a human face.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Its repression after the Soviet-led intervention&nbsp;of August </span><span class="font2">1968 </span><span class="font16">represented a lasting shock for those who held hopes of&nbsp;democratic renewal, leading many East European reformers to embrace&nbsp;dissent and opposition </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">even though reformist tendencies did also survive&nbsp;in some establishment circles. Defeated in the East, the ideas of reform&nbsp;communism found new focus on the other side of the Iron Curtain.&nbsp;In Western and Southern Europe, Eurocommunism emerged in the mid&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s as a movement aimed at defending the legacy of the Prague Spring,&nbsp;assuming human rights as a component of socialist ideals, offering</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark7"></a>178</span></h3>
<p class="font16">alternatives to the waning appeal of Soviet socialism and challenging the Cold War order both domestically and internationally. Eurocommunists tried to&nbsp;provide criticisms of the Soviet model that were inspired by democratic&nbsp;values, thus differing crucially from revolutionary Maoist and leftist critics.&nbsp;Theirs proved to be a lasting, if ultimately unsuccessful endeavor.</p>
<p class="font16">These failures and frailties notwithstanding, Mikhail Gorbachev<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s reforms would have been unthinkable without the legacy of the Eastern and Western&nbsp;communist reformers. By the late </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">new thinking</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">in international&nbsp;relations and the drive toward change in domestic affairs had established this&nbsp;legacy also within the Kremlin. Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s vision incorporated reform&nbsp;communism</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s appeal for the reassertion of humanistic ideals and its idea of&nbsp;nonviolent transformation as opposed to the Stalinist legacy. He adopted&nbsp;interdependence as a category for interpreting global processes, which made&nbsp;both </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">world revolution</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and the Cold War obsolete. However, the new&nbsp;Soviet leadership also inherited all the basic contradictions of reform communism. While in the West Eurocommunism had lost momentum, crisis and&nbsp;collapse in Eastern Europe and the USSR sealed the fate of reform, which&nbsp;proved unable to sustain itself as a credible alternative path in communist&nbsp;history.</span></p>
<p class="font16">This chapter proposes to analyze reform communism as a historical phenomenon that cannot be equated with <span class="font2">perestroika </span><span class="font16">alone, even if its&nbsp;historical meaning should primarily be understood in light of Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s&nbsp;reforms. Reform communism had three distinctive features. First, it was&nbsp;never a consistent movement equipped with de</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nite ideas and strategies.&nbsp;Rather, it was a divided and fragmented transnational set of concepts and&nbsp;practices aimed at reform from above. It partially emerged in the aftermath of&nbsp;de-Stalinization and then took shape as a form of cultural and political&nbsp;renewal in speci</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">c chronological and national contexts, in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uencing groups&nbsp;of intellectuals and party of</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cials in several countries. Second, ideas of reform&nbsp;were formulated in terms of recovering the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">original inspiration</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">of communism and Marxism, which they construed as a humanistic tradition.&nbsp;Although reform communists increasingly interacted with social democracy,&nbsp;they did not want to change their own identity, even when their priorities&nbsp;and agendas became more similar to those ofsocial democrats than to those&nbsp;ofother communists. Third, reform communism was essentially a European&nbsp;and Russian phenomenon that failed to exert substantial in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uence over&nbsp;communists outside Europe. Ideas of peaceful change were not devoid of&nbsp;global re</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ections, particularly in India and Latin America, but the violent&nbsp;context of the Cold War prevented their spread. This geographical</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark9"></a>179</span></h3>
<p class="font16">localization notwithstanding, reform communism captured and epitomized broader historical trends and transformations. In particular, its encounter&nbsp;with the issue of human rights should be understood in a global perspective,&nbsp;as it crucially revealed the exhaustion of the European legacy of political&nbsp;revolutions. Reform communism was an essential part of the metamorphosis&nbsp;of this tradition, which became manifest in the peaceful collapse of <span class="font2">1989</span><span class="font16">.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Transnational Change from Above: De-Stalinization and “Socialism with a Human Face”</span></h2>
<p class="font16">After the death of Stalin, ideas of reform found various advocates among the communist leaderships. In private and public discourse, uneven elements of&nbsp;change surfaced between <span class="font2">1953 </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font2">1956 </span><span class="font16">which would become archetypes for&nbsp;reform communists at a later stage. An entire set of measures and statements&nbsp;indirectly contested the Stalinist legacy of terror, forced Sovietization in&nbsp;Eastern Europe and even the Cold War. However, neither were these&nbsp;initiatives uni</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ed into a political project, nor did any single communist </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">gure&nbsp;come to embrace a coherent reformist platform.</span></p>
<p class="font16">We now know that there were elements of truth in the <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">legend</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">of Lavrentii Beria as a reformer in </span><span class="font2">1953</span><span class="font16">. Indeed, he and his ally Georgii&nbsp;Malenkov did show their readiness to undertake change in Soviet domestic&nbsp;and foreign policy, particularly by envisaging the rehabilitation of repressed&nbsp;individuals, adopting welfare measures, reducing Cold War engagements&nbsp;and even negotiating the reuni</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cation of Germany. Power struggles in the&nbsp;Soviet leadership and the upheaval in East Germany in June </span><span class="font2">1953 </span><span class="font16">thwarted&nbsp;more signi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cant change.</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font16">After Beria</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s arrest and execution, Malenkov tried&nbsp;to carry on the same agenda for some time before himself being marginalized&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2">1955 </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">as were his partners in Eastern Europe, beginning with Imre Nagy in&nbsp;Hungary. In the Soviet Union, many of their ideas were picked up by&nbsp;Malenkov</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s rival Nikita Khrushchev, who turned de-Stalinization into public&nbsp;discourse and a collective shock for all communists. The Twentieth Congress&nbsp;of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in </span><span class="font2">1956 </span><span class="font16">would long be regarded&nbsp;by many reform communists as a harbinger of unful</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">lled promises of change.&nbsp;Yet this change from above hardly inspired a consistent shift away from the&nbsp;Stalinist legacy, and it again lost its hold when the perspective of liberalization&nbsp;began destabilizing the communist regimes.

<p class="font16">The rebellions against Soviet rule in Eastern Europe took on the character of <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ghts for national independence, but they also exhibited a transnational&nbsp;effect. Especially among the younger generations, hopes of democratizing&nbsp;socialism had taken the place of the drive for anti-fascist and socialist transformation shared by European communists at the end of World War II.</span><span class="font2"><sup>3&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font16">The communist establishments, still speaking the language of civil war&nbsp;inherited from the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst half of the twentieth century, failed to understand&nbsp;the meaning of this shift from revolutionary to reform thinking and instead&nbsp;saw the risk of a catastrophic </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">domino effect</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">led by anti-communist forces.&nbsp;Even leaders such as Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia and Palmiro Togliatti in&nbsp;Italy </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">who, unlike Khrushchev, had both denounced the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">bureaucratic&nbsp;degeneration</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">of Stalinism </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">perceived developments in Hungary as&nbsp;a threat, although they would later acknowledge the popular character of the&nbsp;uprising.</span><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font16">As Nagy was tragically left alone to speak the language of socialist&nbsp;democracy in his writings from prison, this language became a form of&nbsp;dissent.</span><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font16">The repression in Hungary initiated a shock wave within the communist world. The prospects of reconstructing its political culture so as to&nbsp;consistently include ideas of reform dissipated, while in both East and West&nbsp;prominent intellectuals who had believed in the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">humanist potential</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">of&nbsp;communism turned into Marxist dissidents </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">as in the cases of Leszek&nbsp;Ko</span><span class="font2">l</span><span class="font16">akowski and E.

<p class="font16">The only sector in which reformist concepts could be openly debated and even experimented with, if only to a very limited extent, was that of&nbsp;economics <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">as the accomplishment of postwar reconstruction increasingly&nbsp;raised the problem ofef</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciency and productivity. The result was on the one&nbsp;hand the politicization ofthis realm, and on the other the reduction of any&nbsp;form of political change to administrative measures. Criticizing the Stalinist&nbsp;legacy ofthe hypercentralized command economy, reformerslooked back to&nbsp;the NEP (New Economic Policy) and to the ideas of Nikolai Bukharin as&nbsp;alternative models for organizing a socialist economy. Economists such as&nbsp;Yevsei Liberman in the USSR and Ota </span><span class="font2">S</span><span class="font16">ik in Czechoslovakia translated these&nbsp;inspirations into schemes for adopting decentralizing measures and&nbsp;a regulated amount of market-inspired and ef</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciency-enhancing principles,&nbsp;while leaving in place the planned economy system. However, reform ideas&nbsp;and projectshit a brick wall whenever their political implications became too&nbsp;broad or too manifest.</span><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font16">The same was true of Yugoslav self-management,&nbsp;which attracted some interest especially in Poland but again encountered&nbsp;opposition from establishments disquieted by its potential political&nbsp;consequences.</span></p>

This was supposedto allow&nbsp;more autonomy for local actors and enterprises negotiating their own interests&nbsp;with the central authorities. However, these measures were poorly implemented as they met with bureaucratic resistance. An intermittent restructuring&nbsp;practice never affected the traditional primacy given to military spending and&nbsp;an industrial structure dominated by large state-owned enterprises.

<p class="font16">The change in the communist view ofinternational relations proved even more ambiguous. Although adopting the doctrine of<span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">peaceful coexistence</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">and pursuing detente policies seemed to indicate adaptation to a polycentric&nbsp;world, as against uncompromising anti-imperialist positions, no common&nbsp;analytical revision took place, and unorthodox voices remained marginal.&nbsp;Malenkov and Togliatti had proposed innovative re</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ections on the unprecedented nature of nuclear warfare as early as </span><span class="font2">1954</span><span class="font16">. Their observations were,&nbsp;however, never developed, since in interpreting nuclear warfare as a threat to&nbsp;the survival ofall humanity they introduced concepts that could undermine&nbsp;the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">two camps</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">doctrine and delegitimize the communist Cold War.&nbsp;Togliatti</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s vision of </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">polycentrism</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">also remained entirely theoretical as&nbsp;a pattern for acknowledging diversity within the socialist camp and adopting&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">exibility in relations among communist parties in various areas ofthe world.&nbsp;Both the Soviets and the Chinese maintained a state-centric vision of world&nbsp;communism. The idea of </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">unity in diversity</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">was mainly used by Western&nbsp;communists </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">though by the Italians much more than the French </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">as&nbsp;a framework within which to restore the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">national roads</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">to socialism they&nbsp;had proposed at the end of World War II.</span><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">In the space ofa few years, the con<span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ict between the SovietUnion andChina would dwarf many other developments within the communist world as&nbsp;a catalyst of political and ideological concerns.

In terms of political culture, the legacy of anti-fascism&nbsp;represented a key bridge between the two experiences. Anti-fascist language&nbsp;had been distinctive to reform-oriented criticism of the communist states in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1956 </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font2">1968 </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">even if it was an ambivalent language, which was also&nbsp;employed by the regimes for their own legitimation.

<p class="font16">The impulse for keeping alive the invented tradition of <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialism with a human face</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">came from the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista&nbsp;Italiano, PCI), the only major party to uphold the dissent originally expressed&nbsp;against the Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia.

<p class="font16">Although rather inconsistently pursued and mainly oriented to defending only socialist dissidents, this stance signaled the diminished legitimation of&nbsp;the Eastern bloc regimes and the growing pressure exercised, even within the&nbsp;communist movement, by a new universalist discourse on human rights&nbsp;epitomized by the Helsinki conference. However, the Eurocommunists<span class="font17">'&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">partial adoption of the language of human rights did not suf</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ce to earn&nbsp;them political legitimation in the West.

The governments of&nbsp;Western Europe, including the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in West&nbsp;Germany, shared these reservations.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Relations between Eurocommunists and European social democrats were problematic even in the case ofthe PCI. The Italian communists had initiated&nbsp;an informal dialogue with the SPD centered on detente as early as <span class="font2">1967</span><span class="font16">.&nbsp;While undergoing many ups and downs, this relationship decisively contributed to in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uencing the PCI</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s international outlook at the moment it devised&nbsp;the Eurocommunist strategy. The Italian communists reconsidered their&nbsp;view of detente as a tool for altering the European political order in the&nbsp;short term and converged with the SPD position which interpreted the&nbsp;process as involving only a strictly gradual change. It was within this framework that the PCI came to accept Italy</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s membership ofNATO, which was&nbsp;reappraised as a precondition to the maintenance of the East</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West equilibrium that underpinned detente. In the same way, a positive assessment of&nbsp;the social democratic governments and parties</span><span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">international initiatives was&nbsp;instrumental to fashioning the PCI</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s own peculiar Europeanist position.&nbsp;The Italian communists</span><span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">network ofrelations with social democratic parties&nbsp;signi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cantly expanded during the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s, and by the end of the decade it&nbsp;included virtually all ofthe European members ofthe Socialist International.</span></p>
<p class="font16">However, in spite of the more open attitude of a transnational faction of left-wing social democrats, the mainstream leaderships remained cautious&nbsp;over the ideological evolution of Eurocommunism, and generally hostile&nbsp;when confronted with the perspective of communist participation in any&nbsp;Western government.

<p class="font16">Eurocommunism was eventually unable to escape a defeat that depended on basic lack of cohesion as well as on shortcomings suffered by its three&nbsp;founding members in their national strategies. The American (and West&nbsp;European) veto on communist participation in Western governments, on&nbsp;the one hand, and Soviet ideological hostility, on the other hand, were strong&nbsp;enough to contain the PCI. As detente waned and the most important&nbsp;Western communist party went back to opposition in early <span class="font2">1979</span><span class="font16">, the entire&nbsp;transnational strategy fell apart. Moscow</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s harsh reaction against&nbsp;Eurocommunism was effective in forcing the French communists to step&nbsp;back from their vague dissent stances, and all the more so since they were&nbsp;affected domestically by the rise of the socialists.

The turning point was Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s speech made in November </span><span class="font2">1987 </span><span class="font16">upon&nbsp;the seventieth anniversary ofthe October Revolution, in which he declared&nbsp;that </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">it is now impossible to examine global developments exclusively from&nbsp;the point ofview ofthe struggle between two opposing social systems.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">He&nbsp;thus dropped the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">two camps</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">theory that was central to the Soviet Cold&nbsp;War, and instead embraced the perspective of interdependence. This was&nbsp;something that Eastern reformers had imagined and Eurocommunists had to&nbsp;some extent theorized. This was a move away from the dichotomous communist worldview that had shaped revolutionary identity for decades, and&nbsp;that dated back to the </span><span class="font2">1920</span><span class="font16">s. Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s stance implied increasing attention&nbsp;toward social democracy as well as a mounting discontent with the state of&nbsp;the communist movement.

<p class="font16">It can be said that during <span class="font2">1988 </span><span class="font16">Gorbachev and his leading group implemented domestic reforms inspired by </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialism with a human face</span><span class="font17">” -</span><span class="font16">basically aiming at expanding the post-Chernobyl campaign for </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">transparency</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">(</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">glasnost</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span class="font16">) into full acceptance of the concept of human rights, while de</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ning plans to abolish ideological censorship, separate the party from the&nbsp;state and launch market-oriented transition.

<p class="font16">However, there was no way to renewal. Change in Eastern Europe came mainly from below, while the paralysis of the establishments led to their&nbsp;collapse. As it turned out, Gorbachev<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s reforms made this collapse peaceful&nbsp;but could not ultimately prevent it. An irresolvable contradiction emerged&nbsp;between his visions of reform and their compatibility with Soviet-type&nbsp;systems.

He&nbsp;consistently ensured that resorting to force would be a senseless choice.</span><span class="font2"><sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Such consistency waned when it came to sustainable political projects. Even in the Soviet Union, by late <span class="font2">1989 </span><span class="font16">the wave of liberalization had gone&nbsp;well beyond the bounds of one-party democracy, with a polarization&nbsp;between radicalized democratic reformers increasingly distrustful of&nbsp;Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s caution, and the blind resistance ofan establishment frustrated&nbsp;bythe</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">loss</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font16">oftheEuropeansphereofin</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uence.

Even ifMarxism</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s legacy was still important for them&nbsp;in terms of devising grand designs drawing on an elevated idea of politics as&nbsp;the crucial transformative force of society, they acknowledged the importance ofhuman rights to global civilization and tried to embed it into a vision&nbsp;ofuniversalist socialist politics.

<p class="font14">andRE StEinER</p>
<p class="font16">One of the starting points for the decline of Soviet-type economies was the suppression of the Prague Spring in <span class="font2">1968 </span><span class="font16">and the concomitant discontinuation of the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst wave of economic reforms within Eastern bloc states in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2">1960</span><span class="font16">s. The system then </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nally collapsed in the late </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s and early </span><span class="font2">1990</span><span class="font16">s,&nbsp;the causes of which are explored here. The initial focus is on the repeated&nbsp;changes in economic control within the countries examined, Czechoslovakia,&nbsp;East Germany (German Democratic Republic, or GDR), Hungary, Poland&nbsp;and the Soviet Union, as well as on their fundamental problems and the&nbsp;solutions suggested during the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s and </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, before then considering the&nbsp;economic policies pursued by the communist parties in power within these&nbsp;countries. In a third step, the focus shifts to changes in the world economy&nbsp;and their consequences for Eastern bloc states. On this basis, some light can&nbsp;be shed on the resulting development of consumption and growth before&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nally turning to the process of the dissolution of Soviet-type economies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Economic Control</span></h2>
<p class="font16">With the economic reforms of the <span class="font2">1960</span><span class="font16">s, party leaders within the Eastern bloc tried to respond to the fundamental problems of the Soviet-type&nbsp;planned economy. These were supposed to accelerate economic growth&nbsp;now that the production factors available had been widely exhausted and&nbsp;the extensive sources of growth had thus reached their limits. The reforms&nbsp;were based on the idea that planning and the market could be connected so&nbsp;as to allow mutual complementation and correction, albeit that the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">market </span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">was to remain an instrument of central economic control.

<p class="font16">planned economy without introducing the fundamentals of a market economy.<span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font16">Yet, for various reasons, the reforms proved to be only partially&nbsp;successful. The violent suppression of the Prague Spring in </span><span class="font2">1968 </span><span class="font16">suffocated&nbsp;ideas of reform and brought them to an end. Their internal contradictions&nbsp;and disputes over which course to take, Soviet pressure and the in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uence&nbsp;of other more conservative party leaders, as well as a sensed threat to the&nbsp;maintenance of power, ultimately brought all rulers to retreat from the&nbsp;risky reform policy.</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font16">There was a departure from monetary and decentralized instruments, and direct planning of production and distribution of&nbsp;certain goods was now practiced more than before. So central economic&nbsp;control as de</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ned by the classical model of the Soviet-type economy was&nbsp;reestablished to varying degrees within the individual states.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Yet the fundamental problems of Soviet-type economies were thus exacerbated: especially the problems of information and of incentives. As this system was supposed to do without prices as an independent source of information,&nbsp;central of<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ce </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">in the form of the central economic agencies and the economic&nbsp;departments within party headquarters </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">could draw the necessary information&nbsp;for economic decisions only from the planning process itself. However, within&nbsp;this bureaucratic and hierarchical process, information was falsi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ed due to the&nbsp;different interests ofsubordinate and superior levels. In addition, the variety and&nbsp;complexity ofthe economic process made it impossible for all the appropriate&nbsp;information to be gathered centrally in the necessary quality and to make&nbsp;optimal economic decisions. As a result, those in charge ofthe economy focused&nbsp;mainly on political priorities in accordance with their claim to leadership.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Beyond this aspect, it proved dif<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cult to motivate enterprises and employees to achieve the highest performance. The state ownership ofmachines and factories </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">under the ideological gloss of being the property of workers&nbsp;and farmers, or of the people </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">was no guarantee of higher work motivation&nbsp;and work performance. At the same time, communist regimes also required&nbsp;economic growth to satisfy the expanding needs of their populations and to&nbsp;stand up to competition with the West. However, the pressure to perform,&nbsp;which was necessary in economic terms, was inconsistent with the system</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s&nbsp;legitimacy </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">based as it was, for example, on the claim of guaranteeing full</span></p>

<p class="font16">In addition to the problems of information and of incentives, there was also a widespread lack of innovation that was caused by the system itself.&nbsp;It was the result of enterprises being <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">xed to the (quantitative) ful</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">llment of&nbsp;the plan, which made any innovation a disruption. This was one of the&nbsp;fundamental reasons why technological developments and the ef</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciency of&nbsp;Soviet-type economies increasingly lagged behind those of developed industrial states in the West.</span><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">In order to reduce the complexity of economic control from the perspective ofcentral of<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ce, from the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s bigger economic units </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">industrial combines or&nbsp;industrial associations </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">were set up within all the states examined here, and&nbsp;were granted greater rights, but these only partially came into effect.&nbsp;As a result, the average size of industrial units was larger than in the West.&nbsp;While this met economic requirements in some ways, these combines often&nbsp;proved to be unwieldy and risk-averse. In consequence they tended to develop&nbsp;into autarkic economic units. A reduction in the division oflabor also ensued,&nbsp;which led to a substantial loss of ef</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciency.</span><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Aside from what were essentially organizational changes, the GDR and Czechoslovakia avoided further comprehensive reform of the planned&nbsp;economy during their last two decades, as did the Soviet Union up to the&nbsp;mid <span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s. At the same time, attempts were made to improve the system of&nbsp;control by tinkering with the basic targets and incentives for enterprises and&nbsp;their employees. But such a piecemeal approach did not solve existing&nbsp;problems.</span><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font16">In Poland too it remained the case that </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">driven by acute crises&nbsp;and worker unrest </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">reform attempts were initially half-hearted.

<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Economic Policy</span></h2>
<p class="font16">In December <span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">, workers in Poland reacted to an austerity program with strikes, which were then bloodily suppressed. They were a re</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ection of the&nbsp;widespread dissatisfaction with living conditions in the Eastern bloc. This&nbsp;triggered an about-turn in economic and social policies in </span><span class="font2">1971 </span><span class="font16">across all&nbsp;Eastern bloc countries aside from Romania. The course of modernization&nbsp;previously introduced in several countries, which had been linked to economic reform to the detriment of the consumer goods industry, was now to&nbsp;be replaced by a policy that aimed to improve the situation of workers, with&nbsp;a comprehensive package of welfare measures and a better supply of consumer goods. The party leaderships</span><span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">prime aim was to pacify the workers&nbsp;while securing their own power. This policy clearly followed the Hungarian&nbsp;model where this barter hadlongbeen established: political calminreturn for&nbsp;relative af</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uence and social security.</span><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Given the strained supply situation and a limited production capacity for consumer goods, this strategy meant that additional imports were required in&nbsp;most countries. As the possibilities of exporting had an overall limit, however, this involved the necessity of borrowing <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">mostly from the West.&nbsp;Another fundamental problem within this context was the fact that consumer&nbsp;goods and social bene</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ts were not linked to incentives for employees.

<p class="font16">consumption limited the means available for the development of technological innovation and investment.</p>
<p class="font16">As a way out ofthis conundrum, several countries turned to an import-led growth strategy: Not only various supplies and materials were imported from&nbsp;the West but also machinery and plant equipment in order to increase&nbsp;growth. The money borrowed for these imports was supposed to be covered&nbsp;by the additional returns expected from the modern technologies. Yet this&nbsp;calculation proved to be <span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">awed because actual returns were less than those&nbsp;expected: On the one hand, the imported technologies failed to lead to the&nbsp;anticipated jump in productivity because they were often applied in isolation.&nbsp;On the other, the competitiveness ofexport goods was not increased to the&nbsp;extent necessary to allow their export to the West in substantial quantities.&nbsp;In sum, this strategy led to a spiral of growing imports from the West and&nbsp;sinking returns from exports, which increased the level of debt to the West&nbsp;while economic substance at home was increasingly drained. Such a policy&nbsp;was broadly followed by the GDR and Hungary while Czechoslovakia and&nbsp;the Soviet Union were more reserved in this respect. The strategy was,&nbsp;however, most pronounced in Poland, where during the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst half of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s an unprecedented investment boom was set off, but this was in itself&nbsp;unbalanced and then led to a growing dependence ofproduction and investments on imports from the West. When in </span><span class="font2">1976 </span><span class="font16">debts and debt servicing&nbsp;reached a critical level, investments were cut arbitrarily. As a result, projects&nbsp;were left un</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nished and substantial losses were incurred.</span><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">All in all, debt service and expenditure on consumption were growing, which reduced the scope for investment even more. Within the individual&nbsp;states, the increases in investment were cut to varying degrees or had to be&nbsp;cut back absolutely. This led to a growing number of un<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nished projects&nbsp;which did not come into operation, straining the ef</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciency ofthe funds thus&nbsp;employed. Moreover, even the replacement ofworn-out machinery was not&nbsp;guaranteed, so that the proportion of run-down facilities still operating&nbsp;rapidly increased. Nevertheless, in order to achieve the most possible with&nbsp;more and more limited investment funds, the party leaderships in some&nbsp;countries concentrated these on certain priorities. This involved mainly&nbsp;parts ofthe arms industry in the case ofthe Soviet Union; inothercountries&nbsp;power generation remained a priority. In contrast, a program to promote the&nbsp;development ofmicroelectronics was launched in the latter halfofthe </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s</span></p>

<p class="font16">Yet such programs failed to solve existing problems. To the contrary, in the sectors that were not especially promoted, these were even strengthened. In particular, the monopoly enjoyed by the combines or associations,&nbsp;the relatively low qualitative demands of trade within the Eastern economic alliance (the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon)&nbsp;and a control mechanism that still continued to reward mainly quantitative&nbsp;growth prevented a successful renewal of production. Isolation from the&nbsp;international division of labor and the resulting relatively broad range of&nbsp;goods both had the same effect. They dissipated research and development&nbsp;activities and thus produced only few results. This was also one reason why&nbsp;the provision of industry with modern equipment was poor by international standards; in the case ofthe latest developments, such as in computing and information technology, the Eastern bloc countries increasingly fell&nbsp;behind.<span class="font2"><sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">At the same time, the growing imports of Western technology and consumer goods worsened <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">to differing degrees </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">the debt level ofEastern bloc countries to the West. The political fear ofthus becoming dependent on the&nbsp;competitor</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s system was overcome, on the one hand, by East</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West detente.&nbsp;On the other, it was believed that, given the high rate ofin</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation in the West&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s and initially low nominal interest, the real costs of the debts&nbsp;would be very low or even negative, which encouraged borrowing all the&nbsp;more. In the West, the latter was supported because of its own economic&nbsp;crisis of </span><span class="font2">1973</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font2">75</span><span class="font16">, the liquidity of its banks, the petrodollar surplus and the&nbsp;belief of the West in the Soviet </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial umbrella. By the latter half of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s, the debts of some of the Eastern bloc countries, especially Poland,&nbsp;Hungary and the GDR, had already increased so strongly that a growing part&nbsp;ofnew loans had to be used to service existing debts.</span><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">At the end ofthe <span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s, the majority ofEastern bloc states were already in massive economic dif</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">culties, determined not only by domestic developments as outlined above but also by changes in the external economic&nbsp;environment.</span></p>

<p class="font16">In the <span class="font2">1950</span><span class="font16">s and </span><span class="font2">1960</span><span class="font16">s, world market prices for raw materials increased only slowly at </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst but the boom in the developed industrial states and the&nbsp;economic rise of some Asian countries had already gradually strengthened&nbsp;the price increase prior to the oil price shock of </span><span class="font2">1973</span><span class="font16">. Although the causes&nbsp;were diverse, this marked the end of the boom, and the capitalist world&nbsp;economy fell into a deep recession. These developments seemed at </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst not&nbsp;to concern Eastern bloc states as they imported most raw materials they&nbsp;required from the Soviet Union at prices that noticeably lagged behind world&nbsp;market prices. However, following the increase in prices for raw materials,&nbsp;the prices for semi-</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nished and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nished products also increased on the world&nbsp;markets; these had to be paid by the USSR too for corresponding imports.&nbsp;The Soviet Union thus pressed the other Comecon members for changes to&nbsp;the existing price mechanism within the economic alliance. So, after </span><span class="font2">1975</span><span class="font16">,&nbsp;prices for raw material supplies within Comecon responded to price movements on the world market more quickly and decisively than before.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Thus the prices to be paid by Eastern bloc states increased more rapidly, and a further upward development was foreseeable: Between <span class="font2">1971 </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font2">1978&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">the price for raw oil within Comecon increased fourfold and on the world&nbsp;markets sixfold. These price increases for raw oil in particular forced Eastern&nbsp;bloc states, depending on their own resources, to introduce radical cuts,&nbsp;comprehensive measures of substitution and corresponding structural&nbsp;changes in raw-material consumption and power generation. They were&nbsp;immensely expensive and had a number of negative consequences </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">such&nbsp;as for the environment, for example </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">but these were taken into account in&nbsp;order to improve domestic reserves of hard currencies.

These indirect forms&nbsp;ofsupport were not, however, based on political considerations, but resulted&nbsp;from the fact that, within the restricted trading area of Comecon, prices&nbsp;systematically deviated from world market prices </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">one could say in correspondence to the existing relations ofscarcity.</span><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font16">Nevertheless, prices forraw&nbsp;materials continued to rise here during the latter halfofthe </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s due to the&nbsp;mechanics of the Comecon price-</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">xing mechanism, while world market&nbsp;prices, especially for raw oil, fell. So the implicit subsidies for the countries&nbsp;involved were lost to varying degrees from the mid </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s. In consequence,&nbsp;the value of Comecon for its member states also continued to dwindle.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Established in <span class="font2">1949</span><span class="font16">, the Eastern economic alliance was, from the </span><span class="font2">1960</span><span class="font16">s, primarily supposed to promote the economic division of labor within the&nbsp;Eastern bloc. As currencies were not convertible, however, the mechanisms&nbsp;of the planned economy meant that </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">despite all the reform discussions&nbsp;already held in the </span><span class="font2">1960</span><span class="font16">s </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">no more was achieved than a bilateral exchange&nbsp;of goods, and the integration ofthe national economies into one economic&nbsp;area remained out ofreach.

<p class="font16">In addition, given the lack ofintegrative effects within Comecon, East<span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West trade grew signi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cantly more quickly than trade within Comecon from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s onward.

<p class="font16">Yet the growing trade between the East and West was <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">as already illustrated </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">linked to initially favorable borrowing terms and East</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West&nbsp;detente, which facilitated trade, but this came to a close at the end ofthe&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s: A further round ofthe arms race took its economic toll on the Soviet&nbsp;Union too, and from the early </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s the USA worked on </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ghting the&nbsp;Eastern bloc economically.

<p class="font16">At the beginning of the <span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, a debt crisis emerged in Eastern Europe, and Poland proved to be the focal point. The particular issue within this&nbsp;country was rooted in the interlinked economic and political crises between&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1979 </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font2">1982</span><span class="font16">. The con</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">icts between workers and the regime, which cannot&nbsp;be dealt with in detail here, were primarily the result of social and economic&nbsp;dif</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">culties and thus worsened not only the political but also the economic&nbsp;situation.</span><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font16">So, by the spring of </span><span class="font2">1981</span><span class="font16">,Poland was practically bankrupt, and at&nbsp;the same time the Soviet Union declared that there would be no </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial&nbsp;umbrella for Eastern bloc states. In addition, Romania not only had liquidity problems but also failed to inform its creditors of this and omitted to pay&nbsp;for received goods.</span><span class="font2"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font16">Taken together, these developments damaged the&nbsp;creditworthiness of other Eastern bloc states too and exacerbated their&nbsp;situation.</span></p>
<p class="font16">When atthe endof <span class="font2">1981 </span><span class="font16">martial law was declared in Poland, Western states imposed credit sanctions on all Eastern bloc countries, which worsened the&nbsp;situation throughout the bloc and especially in Poland. Subsequently the&nbsp;country had to generate a trade surplus: Imports were cut even more and&nbsp;exports, especially of coal and food, were slowly increased. With the trade&nbsp;surplus thus achieved, Poland was able to service the loans from commercial&nbsp;banks while the (far greater) obligations to Western states were still&nbsp;neglected, so total debts continued to grow. Overall, this policy withdrew&nbsp;from the Polish national economy resources that would have been necessary&nbsp;for any forward-looking investments.</span><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Other Eastern bloc states,suchasthe GDR and Czechoslovakia, also reacted to the credit ban imposed by the West with import reductions and export&nbsp;campaigns in order to reduce debts (which in the case of Czechoslovakia were&nbsp;lower anyway). Here East Germany received <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">with bankruptcy imminent </span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">indirect support not just from West Germany but from the Soviet Union too.&nbsp;Given the lower competitiveness of its products, however, increases in exports&nbsp;were solely possible at dumping prices which diminished economic assets.</span><span class="font2"><sup>21&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font16">Hungary was able to solve its acute balance-of-payments crisis in </span><span class="font2">1982 </span><span class="font16">only&nbsp;by joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.&nbsp;Nevertheless, attempts were also made in this situation to increase exports in</span></p>

<p class="font16">The case ofthe Soviet Union regarding the question ofdebts deserves to be examined in its own right: While it pro<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ted from the worldwide increase in&nbsp;oil and gas prices, this was counteracted by years of crop failure and the&nbsp;concomitant import demands. At the same time, as a result of the oil price&nbsp;increases, it also suffered from a drop in imports from the West in terms of&nbsp;real prices. The end ofdetente and the sanctions by the West which followed&nbsp;the invasion ofAfghanistan in </span><span class="font2">1979 </span><span class="font16">were also not without effect. As a result,&nbsp;the Soviet Union also developed a tendency toward trade de</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cits with the&nbsp;West, although these were initially covered by the sale ofgold and weapons&nbsp;and only then through borrowing, to which the Soviets had also maintained&nbsp;a more cautious approach. In line with this, they reduced imports ofmachin-ery and technology as more grain imports became necessary.</span><span class="font2"><sup>24</sup> </span><span class="font16">Even so, in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1982 </span><span class="font16">they were also hit by the credit ban imposed by the West.</span></p>
<p class="font16">It was not until <span class="font2">1984 </span><span class="font16">that this situation changed, once the Eastern bloc states had reduced their debts and had again received bigger loans. The&nbsp;external liabilities of the Eastern bloc fell markedly between </span><span class="font2">1981 </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font2">1984</span><span class="font16">.&nbsp;Nonetheless, after </span><span class="font2">1984 </span><span class="font16">they increased signi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cantly again, and by the end of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1987 </span><span class="font16">they exceeded the maximum level of </span><span class="font2">1981</span><span class="font16">. However, the rise in debt&nbsp;levels prior to </span><span class="font2">1981 </span><span class="font16">had been linked to a strong growth in East</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West trade,&nbsp;while after </span><span class="font2">1984 </span><span class="font16">Eastern bloc exports to the West dwindled. So the ratio&nbsp;between gross liabilities in the West and exports in the same direction had&nbsp;improved forthe Easternbloc countries from </span><span class="font2">100 </span><span class="font16">percent in </span><span class="font2">1981</span><span class="font16">to </span><span class="font2">75 </span><span class="font16">percent&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2">1984</span><span class="font16">, but by the end of </span><span class="font2">1986 </span><span class="font16">it had already risen again to </span><span class="font2">130 </span><span class="font16">percent.&nbsp;The structural dilemma faced by Eastern bloc states was that on the one hand</span></p>

<p class="font16">As the explosion in world market prices for raw materials was keenly felt in the Eastern bloc too, even the last ofthe communist leaders began to falter in&nbsp;their conviction, established by Stalin, that there were two separate <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">one&nbsp;capitalist and one socialist </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">world markets. Facing increasing economic&nbsp;problems at home, stronger attempts were made to do business with the&nbsp;West beyond foreign trade alone. The Eastern bloc states had already agreed&nbsp;on so-called compensation agreements since the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s. These involved&nbsp;investment goods from the West being supplied on credit over several&nbsp;years, and these loans were in turn re</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nanced with countersupplies of&nbsp;those products which were produced with the machinery and plant equipment that had been imported in this way. In this manner, companies in the&nbsp;West employed the Eastern bloc as their </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">extended workbench</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">in reaction&nbsp;to the rising costs (prices for raw materials, lending rates). These transactions&nbsp;can indeed be understood as the functional equivalent of direct foreign&nbsp;investments under the particular conditions of the Eastern bloc. Direct&nbsp;foreign investments in their classical form remained relatively small within&nbsp;Eastern bloc states but increased at this low level over the course ofthe </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s,&nbsp;a development in which Hungary played a pioneering role.</span><span class="font2"><sup>26</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">A further instrument of cooperation was perceived in East<span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West joint ventures for which in the latter half of the </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s not only Hungary and&nbsp;Poland, but also the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, established a legal&nbsp;framework. However, this form of company initially remained an isolated&nbsp;phenomenon within Eastern bloc countries. Not until </span><span class="font2">1988</span><span class="font16">, when it became&nbsp;permissible for foreign investors to hold the majority interest in joint ventures in&nbsp;the USSR, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, did the number ofEast</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">West&nbsp;joint ventures multiply in these states and especially in the Soviet Union.</span><span class="font2"><sup>27</sup></span></p>

These institutions were of interest to Eastern bloc states primarily&nbsp;because of the promise of access to new loans. In addition, these institutions&nbsp;were later instrumentalized in some of these countries as a forceful embodiment of market principles.</span><span class="font2"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font16">This took place in the context of efforts to&nbsp;reform the existing system in the late </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, which heralded the path ahead&nbsp;of transformation into a market economy. Yet it was probably the ever-faster&nbsp;spread of consumer wishes and consumption patterns in the context of&nbsp;globalization that made a substantial contribution to the dissolution of the&nbsp;planned economy and the end of the Eastern bloc.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark103"></a>The Development of Consumption and Growth</span></h2>
<p class="font16">In the West, mass consumer society had been established by the <span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s, at the latest, and consumer demands developed in ever-greater variety, becoming&nbsp;more and more re</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ned. This development represented a real problem for&nbsp;the leaderships of the communist parties within the Eastern bloc </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">and all the&nbsp;more so the closer the country in question was to the western border of&nbsp;the bloc and the greater the opportunities of its citizens to travel as well as the&nbsp;greater number of visitors from the West. The people living within the&nbsp;Eastern bloc states learnt via TV and radio, from visitors and their own visits&nbsp;about the consumer possibilities now available in the West. There it was no&nbsp;longer a question of satisfying simple consumer needs but increasingly about&nbsp;certain types of clothes or brands of car. Within Eastern bloc states, the&nbsp;younger generations in particular expected a corresponding range of goods&nbsp;within their own country. But, at best, the communist party leaders could,&nbsp;and wanted to, meet these demands only in a limited way. By the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, the </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">never to be ful</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">lled </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">claim of socialism to be an alternative to&nbsp;capitalism with its own consumer patterns and goods supply was no longer&nbsp;the issue.</span><span class="font2"><sup>29</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">The supply of consumer goods also remained restricted because their production was always neglected with regard to the allocation of <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nite&nbsp;resources </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">apart from some short-term exceptions.

<p class="font16">West, there were not insigni<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cant differences in living standards between the individual states ofthe Eastern bloc.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Notably, the insuf<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cient goods supply was faced with more or less continually rising nominal incomes. On the one hand, the issue of incentives described earlier made it dif</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cult for company management to adapt performance norms to new technological conditions, so that these norms were&nbsp;rather </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">soft.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">On the other, the party leaderships repeatedly resorted to&nbsp;placating the workers with income increases. What these workers could&nbsp;actually buy with their growing income was then a question not only of&nbsp;what was on offer but also of price developments. Since prices were not&nbsp;determined by the market but by the state, the latter had to take the rising&nbsp;costs into account. The driving forces here were wages and above all the&nbsp;prices for raw materials. In order to counter higher costs, either the supply of&nbsp;consumer goods could be subsidized or prices needed to be pushed up&nbsp;accordingly. For political reasons, the party leaderships shied away from&nbsp;the latter.</span></p>
<p class="font16">In general, the prices for basic needs <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">essential foods and housing as well as energy and public transport </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">were kept at arti</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cially low levels in order to&nbsp;keep them affordable for everybody and thus to achieve one goal of socialism. The necessary subsidies these entailed used up a growing proportion of&nbsp;budget expenditure: In the Soviet Union this increased between </span><span class="font2">1965 </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font2">1989&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">from </span><span class="font2">4 </span><span class="font16">percent to </span><span class="font2">20 </span><span class="font16">percent. In the GDR the proportion was similar.</span><span class="font2"><sup>30&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font16">As a result, the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial resources available for other expenditures such as&nbsp;investments were restricted. Moreover, these subsidies led to abuse and&nbsp;waste.</span></p>
<p class="font16">If, however, these overstretched the <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial options ofthe state, the party leaderships also attempted to increase prices directly, as was repeatedly the&nbsp;case in Poland where it provoked worker unrest. The wage drift inherent in&nbsp;the system, reinforced by the weakness of the regime and the necessity of&nbsp;pacifying the workers, led, in conjunction with the shortage of goods and&nbsp;increases in costs, to an in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ationary wage</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">price spiral. In Poland this constellation became extremely explosive, thus playing its part in the political&nbsp;instability of the country in the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s and </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nally in the path to the&nbsp;transformation process that emerged in the late </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s.</span><span class="font2"><sup>31</sup></span></p>

<p class="font16">Furthermore, the subsidies increased the permanent and growing surplus of purchasing power that was created by the imbalance between growing&nbsp;demand and restricted supply. Assuming a constant propensity to save, this&nbsp;would normally have led to in<span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation, but was (to a great extent) suppressed&nbsp;by the state administration ofprices. At the same time, enterprises always had&nbsp;scope to push up prices for their products which, as was often criticized, led to&nbsp;creeping in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation. Indeed, given the shortages in supply, the surplus in&nbsp;purchasing power and the suppressed in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation, a second economy and&nbsp;black markets inevitably developed. The </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst provided goods and services&nbsp;otherwise in short supply and served as an additional source of income.&nbsp;There also evolved signs ofa new, private entrepreneurship.

According to this estimate, </span><span class="font2">16</span><span class="font16">.</span><span class="font2">3 </span><span class="font16">percent of household&nbsp;income was generated in the second economy and </span><span class="font2">22</span><span class="font16">.</span><span class="font2">9 </span><span class="font16">percent of spending&nbsp;was carried out in this sector in the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s and </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, which represented&nbsp;a contribution of</span><span class="font2">6</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font2">7 </span><span class="font16">percent to the GDP.</span><span class="font2"><sup>33</sup> </span><span class="font16">This was a dimension not to be&nbsp;ignored.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The real incomes within the countries examined here increased in the <span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s and decreased in the </span><span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s.

<p class="font16">Economic growth had a tendency to decline throughout the whole period across all countries examined here, although this included quite some variation between the individual states.<span class="font2"><sup>35</sup> </span><span class="font16">In particular, developments in Poland&nbsp;deviated somewhat from this pattern: During the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst half of the </span><span class="font2">1970</span><span class="font16">s, the&nbsp;import-led growth strategy was still generating marked growth.

<p class="font16">This general pattern of growth can primarily be explained by the fact that the extensive sources of growth were more or less exhausted in most&nbsp;countries, while there was a failure to increase economic ef<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciencyanywhere&nbsp;in such a way as to reach earlier growth rates. In other words, the extensive&nbsp;model of development was maintained. Beyond this, there were also&nbsp;a number of contingent factors involved: The political decision to expand&nbsp;consumption in addition to the explosion in energy costs limited the means&nbsp;available for investment. This problem was to be bypassed through more&nbsp;borrowing. Although the funds acquired in this manner </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">insofar as these&nbsp;were not used for consumption </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">were employed in modern technologies,&nbsp;they failed to result in the returns hoped for,as investment ingeneralfailedto&nbsp;do so. The overall decline in investment ef</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ciency increasingly proved to be&nbsp;a key problem as it also failed to improve the already low level of competitiveness and productivity. With the costs of debt out of control, import cuts&nbsp;and export increases </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nally became necessary. As a result, the disposable&nbsp;national product fell or stagnated, which was again to the detriment of&nbsp;investment and of modern machinery in particular. Moreover, the strategy&nbsp;of exporting as much as possible at all costs meant that those sectors with&nbsp;products that were signi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cant as exports but that could only be sold at&nbsp;dumping prices on the world market were allocated substantially more&nbsp;resources.

<p class="font16">These Soviet-type economies could nevertheless have continued to exist. Mostly political decisions sparked off the process of dissolution of this&nbsp;economic system against the background ofeconomic weakness. The party&nbsp;leaderships reacted to the economic problems in different ways within their&nbsp;individual countries, while neither the reformers nor the <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">conservatives</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">wanted to abolish socialism; both wanted to make it feasible. Party leaders in&nbsp;the GDR and Czechoslovakia chose to continue the existing system and&nbsp;merely to </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">make it more perfect.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Indeed, the economy and living standards&nbsp;of both these countries were clearly on a higher level than in other Eastern&nbsp;bloc states and so, in their eyes, the variant ofthe system they represented&nbsp;was tried and tested </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">at least by comparison to the other Eastern bloc&nbsp;countries.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Hungary, on the other hand, continued its reform program <span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">as described above </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">and its communist leadership, even once the privatization of state&nbsp;property had begun, remained convinced that it was introducing a new&nbsp;model of socialism and not another system, although it was already in the&nbsp;process of doing so.</span><span class="font2"><sup>38</sup> </span><span class="font16">In Poland, communist party leaders wanted stronger&nbsp;reform ofthe existing economic system in </span><span class="font2">1986</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font2">87</span><span class="font16">, following the example of&nbsp;Hungaryinsomerespects:Commercialbanksweresetupandthenumberof&nbsp;ministries reduced.

<p class="font16">decisions made by central of<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ce were diminished. Changes to the structure of ownership were also addressed but remained piecemeal. Not until the&nbsp;reform-oriented government of Mieczys</span><span class="font2">l</span><span class="font16">aw Rakowski came to of</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ce, in&nbsp;mid </span><span class="font2">1988</span><span class="font16">, did these ideas for reorganization become radicalized </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">promoted&nbsp;bya wave ofstrikes provoked by a further worsening ofliving conditions </span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">no&nbsp;longer aiming at a mixed economy as before but at a consolidation ofmarket&nbsp;powers. Controls on prices were lifted step by step, the subsidization of&nbsp;industrial combines and employment guarantees abolished and thus bankruptcy and unemployment made permissible. Moreover, the private sector&nbsp;was now sponsored more than the state sector. In effect, the communist&nbsp;party itself abolished the centrally planned economy.</span><span class="font2"><sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">However, all this was only possible because of the developments in the Soviet Union from the mid <span class="font2">1980</span><span class="font16">s, which had accelerated events in other&nbsp;Eastern bloc states as well. When Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary&nbsp;ofthe Communist Party ofthe Soviet Union in </span><span class="font2">1985</span><span class="font16">, the Soviet Union had also&nbsp;reached its limits: Crop failure and the increasing costs of extracting raw&nbsp;materials against the background of an increasing arms burden, in addition&nbsp;to a falling world market price for oil, all restricted its scope for action.</span><span class="font2"><sup>40&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font16">In consequence, the Soviets could and would no longer support other Eastern&nbsp;bloc states, neither explicitly nor implicitly, albeit that the reduction in implicit&nbsp;subsidies was probably more unintentional. Gorbachev initially remained&nbsp;hesitant with regard to reform because neither the required extent nor the&nbsp;goal seemed clear, and there was substantial opposition to reform within the&nbsp;state bureaucracy. As he then became aware of the extent of the country</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s&nbsp;economic dif</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">culties, he attempted to </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nd ways to end the arms race and to&nbsp;make the Soviet Union viable.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Nevertheless, when in <span class="font2">1987 </span><span class="font16">those in power decided to endorse economic reform, the necessary preparations had not been made, so reform was&nbsp;initially limited to organizational changes. The Enterprise Law of </span><span class="font2">1987&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">deprived the ministries of their powers, and the managers of industrial&nbsp;combines were given more scope for action. But up to this point, the&nbsp;ministries had been responsible for the allocation of resources. In </span><span class="font2">1988&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">even the economic departments within party central of</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ce, which had&nbsp;formerly represented central state control and intervention, were abolished.

At the same time, the central state authorities were thus deprived of more of their authority and credibility. Gorbachev was convinced that, if controls were reduced, producers&nbsp;would multiply their efforts, but in fact the opposite happened:&nbsp;Production collapsed, which promoted regional particularism, tore apart&nbsp;supply networks and in consequence further accelerated the decline in&nbsp;production. Finally, after </span><span class="font2">1991</span><span class="font16">, the transition to the market economy&nbsp;occurred incrementally. </span><span class="font2"><sup>41</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Prior to this, the Soviet Union had already announced in June <span class="font2">1990 </span><span class="font16">that from </span><span class="font2">1991 </span><span class="font16">onward trade with Comecon partners would be possible only in convertible currencies and at current world market prices. This adoption of free-market trade practices marked the end ofthe Eastern economic alliance, which&nbsp;was accelerated by the departure ofthe GDR after German reuni</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cation, just&nbsp;as by the radical political changes in other Eastern bloc states. Comecon&nbsp;formally dissolved itselfin June </span><span class="font2">1991 </span><span class="font16">at a council meeting in Budapest.</span><span class="font2"><sup>42</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">It was an unintended consequence of the communist leaderships<span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">own reforms that they furthered the dismantlement ofthe planned economy and&nbsp;abolition of socialism in general. The decisive cause ofthe economic weakness of the Eastern bloc states was, however, the inability of the socialist&nbsp;economic system to bring about structural as well as technological change&nbsp;from within when faced by the exhaustion of extensive sources ofgrowth.&nbsp;The system was not able to react effectually to the new basic conditions </span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">globally changing prices for important resources and the international spread&nbsp;of a post-Fordist production regime based on </span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">exible technologies </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">and to&nbsp;adapt to them. While developments in foreign trade did make these problems&nbsp;worse, they were not the actual root cause. These were primarily linked to&nbsp;the in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">exibility and the insuf</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cient incentive structures of the control&nbsp;mechanisms as well as to basic economic</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">political decisions which eroded&nbsp;the substance ofthese economies. The Eastern bloc states had </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">some more&nbsp;and others less </span><span class="font17">- </span><span class="font16">lived beyond their means for many years, as is documented&nbsp;by the level ofdebt and the deterioration ofthe capital stock. The inability to&nbsp;meet the growing consumer demands of their own populations, in either&nbsp;quantitative or qualitative terms, accelerated the decline and contributed to&nbsp;the political upheaval of </span><span class="font2">1989</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font2">90</span><span class="font16">.</span></p>

<p class="font16">The economic decline of the Eastern bloc has been examined in various perspectives. The multitude ofeconomic analyses on how Soviet-type economies functioned and their fundamental defects has been expertly summarized&nbsp;by Janos Kornai, <span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Socialist System: The Political Economy of Communism&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">(Oxford: Oxford University Press, </span><span class="font2">1992</span><span class="font16">). Overviews from a general historical&nbsp;perspective which also provide insights into economic processes need not be&nbsp;referred to here as these are already cited in other chapters within this book.&nbsp;For an examination of the long lines of economic change, see Derek&nbsp;H.

As both historian and&nbsp;participator in the processes described, the author provides a more essayistic&nbsp;account ofeconomic developments in Central Eastern and Eastern Europe,&nbsp;with the exemption ofthe case ofthe GDR.

<p class="font10">In the early <span class="font12">1970</span><span class="font10">s, the traditional claims ofcommunist elites that they were part of an expanding global system and an important bulwark against reactionary imperialism had not yet become entirely implausible. Outside Europe,&nbsp;decolonization had, in recent decades, brought socialist </span><span class="font5">- </span><span class="font10">or at least noncapitalist </span><span class="font5">- </span><span class="font10">projects to many countries in Africa and Asia. What communists&nbsp;portrayed as fascism seemed to be on the rise too: Elites often noted the&nbsp;renewed importance of communist solidarity in the </span><span class="font12">1960</span><span class="font10">s and </span><span class="font12">1970</span><span class="font10">s given the&nbsp;ever-widening presence ofright-wing authoritarianism in Latin America, Africa&nbsp;and Southern Europe. Where such right-wing authoritarian regimes were in&nbsp;a state ofdecay </span><span class="font5">- </span><span class="font10">as with the end ofthe Franco and Salazar regimes in the mid&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">1970</span><span class="font10">s </span><span class="font5">- </span><span class="font10">it was still possible to believe that a democratic socialism might take&nbsp;root. Even Henry Kissinger believed the Portuguese </span><span class="font5">“</span><span class="font10">Carnation Revolution</span><span class="font5">” </span><span class="font10">in&nbsp;spring </span><span class="font12">1974 </span><span class="font10">might be a replay of the Russian Revolution, with Mario Soares&nbsp;playing the role of Aleksandr Kerenskii and paving the way for a radical or&nbsp;Bolshevik takeover.</span><span class="font1"><sup>36</sup> </span><span class="font10">In a speech given in September that year, Hungary</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font10">s&nbsp;leader Janos Kadar still had con</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font10">dence that, just as socialists would eventually&nbsp;oust Augusto Pinochet in Chile, so their comrades would overthrow rightwing dictatorship on the Iberian peninsula and take power.</span><span class="font1"><sup>37</sup></span></p>
<p class="font10">Yet over the course ofthe <span class="font12">1970</span><span class="font10">s this worldview was signi</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font10">cantly eroded.

<p class="font10">socialism was unlikely to spread within Europe: The Southern European transitions saw the advent of liberal democracy, with Spanish&nbsp;Eurocommunists breaking with the Soviet (and Portuguese) traditions of&nbsp;popular workers<span class="font5">' </span><span class="font10">democracy, and embracing the liberal-democratic multiparty system. Bythe late </span><span class="font12">1970</span><span class="font10">s, the ideaofEuropeitselfwas </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font10">rmly associated&nbsp;with liberal democracy and with the </span><span class="font5">“</span><span class="font10">politics ofmoderation.</span><span class="font5">”</span><span class="font1"><sup>39</sup></span></p>
<p class="font10">Second, it was increasingly dif<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font10">cult to view the West simply as the enemy. In the early </span><span class="font12">1970</span><span class="font10">s, West German leaders abandoned confrontation, reached&nbsp;out to the East and promised to guarantee previously contested borders with&nbsp;Poland. With the fear of Western revanchism much diminished, the claims&nbsp;that communist regimes were protectors ofthe nation from Western imperialism lost their meaning.</span><span class="font1"><sup>40</sup> </span><span class="font10">Links between East and West European economies increased, too: Central European countries began to privilege export to&nbsp;West European markets and to engage in joint ventures.

<p class="font10">Nonetheless, this did not mean that communists were ready to give up power. The imposition of martial law in Poland in December <span class="font12">1981 </span><span class="font10">demonstrated the limits of such </span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font10">exibility when the authority of regimes was&nbsp;threatened.

The opening of Hungary</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font10">s border in May </span><span class="font12">1989 </span><span class="font10">enabled large&nbsp;numbers of GDR citizens to cross to Austria </span><span class="font5">- </span><span class="font10">leaving their regime increasingly isolated, and its holdon power weakened.

In Romania alone&nbsp;did the regime resort to the use of force, and only here did the world see&nbsp;scenes of violent revolution and the crushing of defeated communists.&nbsp;A repressive state had ensured that there was no organized opposition with&nbsp;whom to negotiate a settlement.

<p class="font10">While Gorbachev<span class="font5">'</span><span class="font10">s voluntary retreat from imperial control is a textbook case ofhistorical contingency and ofthe role ofthe individual in history, the&nbsp;end ofthe Soviet empire, from a world-historical perspective, can be viewed&nbsp;as the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font10">nal stage ofthe European age ofimperialism after the disintegration&nbsp;of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires after World War I, the end&nbsp;of the Nazi Empire in World War II and of the French, British and&nbsp;Portuguese Empires after that. In </span><span class="font12">1960</span><span class="font10">s Eastern Europe, this connection&nbsp;had commonly been made: Both anti-communists who wished to throw off&nbsp;Soviet control, and leftist critics of communist authoritarianism, took&nbsp;inspiration from the postwar decolonization of Africa and Asia and its&nbsp;socialist liberation movements. Nevertheless, by the </span><span class="font12">1980</span><span class="font10">s, few saw themselves as part ofthis tradition. An increasingly assertive nationalism, bare of&nbsp;socialist anti-imperialist rhetoric, and often explicitly anti-socialist, predominated, which called for a re-creation of national culture and a </span><span class="font5">“</span><span class="font10">return to&nbsp;Europe.</span><span class="font5">”</span></p>
<p class="font10">This East European nationalism reverberated in the western parts of the Soviet Union. The political liberalization under Gorbachev in the late <span class="font12">1980</span><span class="font10">s&nbsp;had allowed nationalist sentiments to develop rapidly; the end ofcommunist&nbsp;rule in Eastern Europe further emboldened those who challenged the Soviet&nbsp;regime from within. Popular fronts and human rights movements in the&nbsp;Baltic states demanded political autonomy: Estonian elites, for instance,&nbsp;called for a </span><span class="font5">“</span><span class="font10">Hungarian model.</span><span class="font5">” </span><span class="font10">Following Ceausescu</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font10">s execution, the new&nbsp;Romanian government stoked pan-Romanian anti-Soviet nationalist sentiment in the Soviet republic ofMoldova.</span><span class="font1"><sup>68</sup> </span><span class="font10">Polish actors were the most active&nbsp;in promoting their country as a role model oftransition for Soviet republics,&nbsp;and they helped to inspire a reinvigorated nationalism in the Baltic states,&nbsp;Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova.</span><span class="font1"><sup>69</sup> </span><span class="font10">Polish tourists and organizations smuggled&nbsp;pro-independence literature into the Soviet Union; Polish television was an&nbsp;important source of information during the independence struggle in Latvia&nbsp;and Lithuania.

<p class="font10">The events ofEurope<span class="font5">'</span><span class="font10">s </span><span class="font12">1989 </span><span class="font10">resonated in most parts ofthe world.

The revival of&nbsp;minority nationalisms did not stop at the former Iron Curtain. Radical antiimperialist movements with a socialist bent, from Northern Ireland to West&nbsp;Germany and from the Basque country to Kurdistan, having lost the support&nbsp;of East European secret services, sometimes disbanded, but more often just&nbsp;toned down the socialist element in their nationalist rhetoric.

<p class="font16">The endgame of the history of international communism was highlighted by two events: the dissolution in rapid succession of all communist regimes in&nbsp;Eastern Europe in 1989, and the rapid collapse of Soviet Union two years later.&nbsp;These two events irrevocably changed the political and economic map of&nbsp;Europe; they also demonstrated to the entire world, with the help of satellite&nbsp;television news, the inability of Soviet-type regimes in Europe (unlike in Asia)&nbsp;to adapt to the new challenges of modernization and globalization, or to&nbsp;overcome old ones such as nationalism. In 1989<span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">91, the leadership of the&nbsp;Soviet Union and many ofits constituent republics repudiated all ideological,&nbsp;political and economic tenets that underlined the practical foundations ofthe&nbsp;Soviet communist model. Gorbachev declared a new goal of moving to&nbsp;a </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">mixed economy,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">inspired by the social-economic thinking of the 1960s,&nbsp;and of integrating the country</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s economy with global markets. The Soviet&nbsp;leader also refused to use force to stop the de facto secession of six of </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">fteen&nbsp;Soviet republics and negotiated with the rest on a new voluntary treaty.</span></p>
<p class="font16">After the failed attempt at dictatorship by the State Committee on the Emergency Situation (Gosudarstvennyi komitet no chrezvychainomy&nbsp;polozheniiu, GKChP), formed primarily by the KGB and army leaders&nbsp;in August 1991, the political initiative passedto radical anti-communist forces,&nbsp;led by Boris Yeltsin. These forces seized power in the Russian Federation,&nbsp;the key constituent republic of the USSR. In the spirit of anti-communist&nbsp;<span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">revolution,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Yeltsin adopted an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-style&nbsp;program of shock therapy and privatization for Russia, which meant&nbsp;its economic and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial secession from the union.

<p class="font16">last-minute attempt to patch up the disintegrating common economic and political space, in a form of a confederation of sovereign republics, was an&nbsp;exercise in illusion. On 8 December 1991 the leaders of three republics, the&nbsp;Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus, dissolved the union and agreed to&nbsp;form a nebulous Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
<p class="font16">This chapter argues that Gorbachev<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s reforms set in motion the decomposition of Soviet-style structures, and produced powerful dynamics and forces that tore the Soviet Union apart. First, this was the unraveling of the Soviet&nbsp;economic-</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial system, unintentionally triggered by the transition to&nbsp;a </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">mixed economy.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Second, it was </span><span class="font2">glasnost </span><span class="font5">' </span><span class="font16">and Gorbachev </span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s political liberalization, which led to the removal of the communist party frommanagementof&nbsp;economic and political affairs. These reforms, accompanied by relative freedom of speech and conscience, produced unintended destabilizing effects for&nbsp;the Soviet Union, such as further disorganization of economy and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nances, the&nbsp;anti-communist revolt of the Soviet intelligentsia against the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">totalitarian&nbsp;center,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and the collapse of political legitimacy of the central (</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">union</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font16">) government. Third, it was the rapidly dwindling popular support for Gorbachev, the&nbsp;rise of anti-communist feelings and, above all, the rise of national separatism,&nbsp;conditioned by the federated construction of the Soviet Union, where Soviet-built </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">nationalities</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">had instruments and incentives for secession. Fourth, there&nbsp;were choices for and limitations on the Soviet leadership, most notably&nbsp;Gorbachev, whose strategy failed to tame the destructive tide of anticommunism and national separatism.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The international context was also crucial for understanding the reasons for the Soviet demise. The pressures of the global economy and the need for&nbsp;foreign capital, the sudden collapse of trade between the Soviet Union and&nbsp;East European countries after the decision to use hard currency as the only&nbsp;form of payment, and the persistent clash between Soviet domestic pressures&nbsp;and international commitments, the stance of the United States and the&nbsp;institutional demands of the international <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial system, represented by&nbsp;the IMF, all contributed powerfully to the sense of urgency, the debates&nbsp;and the choices within the Soviet leadership, between Gorbachev and the&nbsp;anti-communist opposition, and between the center and the republics.&nbsp;In a sense, the end of the Soviet Union indeed can be conceptualized not&nbsp;only as a farewell to global communism, but also as the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst major casualty of&nbsp;the new era of capitalist liberal globalization.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The collapse of the Soviet Union remains a subject of intense curiosity, fears, hopes and politics on the territory of the former Soviet republics and&nbsp;elsewhere, particularly in China and other countries still ruled by communist</p>

<p class="font16">parties. Like other milestones of global communism, the end of the USSR would remain in the focus of <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">politics of history</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">with considerable&nbsp;implications for the legitimacy, strategic choices and international behavior&nbsp;of Russia and other countries of Eurasia and Eastern Europe.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark200"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark201"></a>Unintended Economic Crisis</span></h2>
<p class="font16">The Soviet economic crisis and <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial troubles began in the 1970s, when the militarized model of the Soviet economy, built in the 1930s, came into con</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ict&nbsp;with new social realities that emerged in the 1960s: the exhaustion of the cheap&nbsp;pool of peasant labor; the growth of state-funded social programs; the empowerment of trade unions and workers</span><span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">collectives; and the rise of urban and educated&nbsp;groups that lacked incentives for productive labor. From sociological works,&nbsp;inside the USSR and then by emigre sociologists, it became clear that all major&nbsp;groups of Soviet society resisted economic reforms pushed by reform-minded&nbsp;technocrats from above. A number of studies abroad, e.g. by Janos Kornai,&nbsp;revealed severe contradictions in </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">reformed</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">East European economies, with&nbsp;their inability to meet the requirements of a postindustrial, consumerist society.</span></p>
<p class="font16">From the time of Stalin, the stability of the state-run centralized economy rested on three pillars: the state<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s near-monopoly on economic assets and&nbsp;pro</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ts, its tight control over wages and consumption, and severe restrictions&nbsp;on liquid capital in private hands. From time to time, the Soviet state had to&nbsp;announce </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial reform,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">to con</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">scate billions of rubles that people had&nbsp;accumulated, in order to restore the monetary balance. The end of this system,&nbsp;just like its construction, was the result of the Politburo</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s decisions. In 1983, the&nbsp;Politburo created a special commission on reforms headed by Nikolai Ryzhkov;&nbsp;the top economist there was deputy minister of </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nances Stepan Sitarian. Soviet&nbsp;economists returned to the unrealized ideas and concepts of the 1960s, without&nbsp;grasping why the early attempts to move to a </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">mixed economy</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">had failed.</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">In the summer of 1987, on the basis of the work of Ryzhkov<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s commission, Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s Politburo and the Council of Ministers approved the decree&nbsp;</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">On State Enterprises</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font16">; in 1988 a second important decree was passed&nbsp;</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">On Cooperatives.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">The </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst decree authorized directors of plants and&nbsp;factories to retain pro</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ts that had previously been transferred to the state.&nbsp;The idea was that </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">state enterprises</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">(</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialist enterprises</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">in the original&nbsp;draft) would start functioning like Western corporations, investing in</span></p>

<p class="font16">production and improving their own economic performance. Directors, who had no owners<span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">responsibilities, but had access to pro</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ts, only looked&nbsp;for opportunities to transfer these pro</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ts into money in the form ofsalaries.&nbsp;They had no incentive to invest and perform. The creation ofcooperatives,&nbsp;Sitarian</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s pet project, allowed them and union leaders to funnel </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">black&nbsp;cash</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">from the enterprises into their pockets: These cooperatives became&nbsp;the vehicles for privatizing state funds without contributing to productive&nbsp;sectors. The rapid accumulation of cash produced in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation that the Soviet&nbsp;economy could not absorb. Then, in 1988, when Gorbachev began political&nbsp;liberalization, the Soviet leadership began to remove wage controls,&nbsp;to purchase political support among workers. Thus, control over in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation&nbsp;was lost; the old </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial system that had existed since Stalin</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s time was&nbsp;doomed. The State Bank began to issue more and more rubles to match&nbsp;the runaway growth of salaries. In turn, in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation led to the crisis of&nbsp;consumption: Tens of millions of people across the Soviet Union stood&nbsp;in endless lines, in order to buy food and consumer goods that were&nbsp;disappearing from state stores.</span><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Neither Gorbachev and Ryzhkov, nor reform-minded economists, understood the reasons for the disaster. They shared the generational optimism and beliefs ofthe 1960s: They believed that once <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">the mechanism of stagnation,</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">e.g. ignorant and reactionary apparatchiks, was replaced by </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">progressive</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">managers, and once workers received more material incentives, the Soviet&nbsp;economy would resume its growth. They overlooked the fact that workers&nbsp;and managers alike were part ofthe mechanism of stagnation; the more they&nbsp;were empowered, the worse off the Soviet economy and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nances became.&nbsp;Every round of economic reforms merely aggravated the situation. In the&nbsp;end, Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s economists resembled the crew ofthe RMS </span><span class="font2">Titanic</span><span class="font16">: They&nbsp;directed the Soviet economy from one iceberg to another, until it began to&nbsp;leak from all sides and sank.</span></p>
<p class="font16">In 1986<span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">89 international factors added to the negative effects of misguided reforms. The oil price plummeted from more than US$ 35 per barrel to less than US$ 12. During the previous year, because ofwindfall oil pro</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ts&nbsp;in hard currency, the problems of stag</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nding currency for&nbsp;imports were mitigated and concealed; now they broke out of control,&nbsp;aggravating trade balance and credit payments, and exacerbating&nbsp;shortages ofconsumer goods and those endless lines in front ofstate stores.</span></p>

<p class="font16">In addition, Gorbachev also launched a well-intentioned anti-alcohol campaign, an Andropov-style measure <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">to improve workers</span><span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">discipline.</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">The Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster blasted another enormous&nbsp;hole in Soviet budget revenues.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The Soviet economic demise took place in the context of rapid globalization, an information revolution and postindustrialization. This&nbsp;added to Soviet problems, yet does not necessarily explain the Soviet&nbsp;collapse. True, in the United States the regions of the industrial giants,&nbsp;models for Soviet industrialization of the 1930S<span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">1950S, turned into </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">rustbelts.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">But this was only because production began to move to China.&nbsp;In Germany, before and after uni</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cation, a successful (if expensive)&nbsp;modernization of industry took place. The Soviet Union, theoretically,&nbsp;could have followed the same path. It had an advanced technological-scienti</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">c-industrial complex, second to none. There were strong hopes&nbsp;in the 1980s that, given its proper </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">conversion,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">this complex could&nbsp;provide an engine for Soviet reindustrialization and a counterweight to&nbsp;economic disintegration. The fact that this did not happen can be&nbsp;ascribed to the badly designed reforms and the political dynamics&nbsp;in the USSR. Scholars who describe the story of Soviet demise as bizarre&nbsp;self-destruction make a valid point.</span><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">The Soviet military-industrial complex is usually regarded as a problem and an obstacle to reform. How important was the burden ofmilitarization&nbsp;on the Soviet economy? Some American authors claim that Ronald&nbsp;Reagan<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s round of arms control </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">bankrupted</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">the Soviets. Various statements by Gorbachev and Soviet of</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cials lend credibility to this thesis.&nbsp;Certainly, this burden was excessive and consumed the best resources&nbsp;and most skillful labor. Still, the impact ofthis factor on the Soviet crisis of&nbsp;1985</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">90 is hard to measure. For a long time even Soviet leaders did not&nbsp;know how much went on military spending. When the quality ofstatistics&nbsp;improved in 1990</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">91, direct defense expenditures stood at 8</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">10 percent of&nbsp;the Soviet budget; with indirect expenses, to </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nance the 10-million-strong&nbsp;military-industrial complex, the costs probably went up to 20 percent.&nbsp;Still, it was much less than the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">gure of 40 percent that Gorbachev and&nbsp;some Western sources cited. And we still need more credible evidence to&nbsp;conclude that this burden disrupted macroeconomic stability and caused&nbsp;a crisis of payments in the USSR.</span></p>

<p class="font16">Another unconvincing argument is that the military-industrial complex was a major <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">mechanism of stagnation,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">a lobby that allegedly blocked&nbsp;economic reforms. In fact, many people from the military-industrial complex&nbsp;were part of the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">progressive</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">technocratic cadres who in 1985</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">89 supported&nbsp;Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s course of reforms. Engineers and scientists from defense institutes and labs went in droves to take part in pro-Yeltsin rallies in Moscow,&nbsp;Sverdlovsk and other cities. In 1990 the leaders ofmilitary industries, as well&nbsp;as the scienti</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">c-technical personnel, became convinced that market reforms&nbsp;were inevitable. The military-industrial complex began to shrink: In 1990&nbsp;alone, about 300,000 workers, engineers and scientists left for other sectors&nbsp;of the economy. The military budget prepared by the General Staff for 1991&nbsp;envisaged a reduction in expenses, after in</span><span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">ation, and a sharp cut in the&nbsp;purchases ofnew military equipment.</span><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">At the same time, Gorbachev, Soviet economists and leaders ofmilitary industries could not and did not want to trigger the chaotic destruction of&nbsp;the militarized economy. Historically, the defense sectors ofthe economy&nbsp;had accumulated the most skilled labor, the best knowhow and the most&nbsp;advanced equipment. In internal debates, at parliamentary hearings and&nbsp;in discussions of economic programs, the leaders of military industries&nbsp;warned that unregulated privatization and liberalization would deindustrialize the Soviet Union, squandering its scienti<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">c-technological potential.&nbsp;In late 1990, when liberalization and national separatism began to threaten&nbsp;the integrity ofthe military-industrial complex, the Soviet military, as well&nbsp;as directors of defense-related plants and labs, pushed Gorbachev to&nbsp;introduce authoritarian rule, in order to carry out a managed transition&nbsp;to the market. Oleg Baklanov, the head ofthe military-industrial commission, oneproponentofthis option, became a co-organizer ofthe GKChP,&nbsp;which failed in August 1991.</span></p>

<p class="font16">In 1988, facing the failure of economic reforms, Gorbachev drew a <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">neoLeninist</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">conclusion from this failure: that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was at the core ofthe problem.

<p class="font16">was to create a <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">normal</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">state, in which the communist party would no longer perform its dictatorial functions, but would cede them, step by step, to&nbsp;the government ministries and, in the constitutional sense, to the soviets, the&nbsp;representative councils of </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialist democracy</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">that had been touted by&nbsp;Lenin and the old Bolsheviks. This neo-Leninist conclusion could as well be&nbsp;called neo-Trotskyism. It was a remarkable turn for the general secretary,&nbsp;who owed his whole career to the party apparatus.</span></p>
<p class="font16">At the end ofthe year, Gorbachev obtained the Politburo<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s approval of his proposal to reduce the size and functions of the party apparatus.&nbsp;The Secretariat and the central party apparatus lost absolute control&nbsp;over many segments ofthe Soviet economy, and paid party positions on&nbsp;all levels were supposed to be cut by between 500,000 and 700,000 jobs.&nbsp;One Russian historian concluded that, with this reform, Gorbachev </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">was&nbsp;destroying the foundations and stability</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">of the whole political system.</span><span class="font2"><sup>5&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font16">Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s idea oftransforming the CPSU into a </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">normal</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">political party&nbsp;turned out to be utopian. The communist party, after so many decades of&nbsp;dictatorial power, stood no chance, at least for a while, of gaining any&nbsp;popular support.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Gorbachev advanced a neo-Leninist project ofreviving the government ofsoviets. With the consent ofhis colleagues, he changed (in a completely&nbsp;authoritarian way) the Soviet constitution, to convene a Congress of&nbsp;People<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s Deputies: Two-thirds of its 2,250 members were elected according&nbsp;to the majoritarian system. The CPSU and other </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">public organizations</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">(e.g. the Academy of Sciences, trade unions, etc.) nominated one-third.&nbsp;The party secretaries, who did not get secure nominations, were encouraged </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">to run</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">like everyone else in contested elections. The old methods&nbsp;of ballot-stuf</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ng, as well as new public relations technologies, were not&nbsp;used; as a result the elections in March 1989 ended in humiliating defeat&nbsp;for many senior party of</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cials. The Congress that opened at the end&nbsp;of May became a televised </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">feast</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">of free speech, which shocked the&nbsp;country.</span></p>

This&nbsp;fateful liberalization had nothing to do with creating new market institutions.&nbsp;There were no attempts to create self-funded corporations under central&nbsp;control and regulation. The ministers and top managers ofmajor industries,&nbsp;which used to be under strict party control, realized that they could take&nbsp;advantage of enormous state assets for self-enrichment, without any incentives to increase their productivity.

And why did so many adopt ideas and language from rightwing libertarians and anti-communists in the West, rejecting the entire&nbsp;legacy of Russian socialism?

<p class="font16">By launching political liberalization, Gorbachev put the cart before the horse (the economy). Incidentally, this overlapped with a general dissident&nbsp;belief in the primacy of politics and political culture over economics.&nbsp;The result was the political mobilization of workers, organized in Sovietstyle trade unions: While demanding more power and more money, these&nbsp;unions continued to undermine the Soviet economy with their strikes.&nbsp;The Soviet leader had to make more economic concessions to workers,&nbsp;but the radical opposition offered even more. Eventually, Gorbachev gave&nbsp;up on economic reforms and had to focus all his energy on the construction&nbsp;of new institutions and constitutional foundations for Soviet statehood.&nbsp;Pressed by the growing anti-communist momentum, in February 1990, the&nbsp;general secretary forced the CPSU to accept the end of its constitutional&nbsp;political monopoly.

<p class="font16">Deputies in March 1990 approved constitutional changes: Instead of the Politburo, it sanctioned the new executive institution of the presidency.&nbsp;After intense debates, the same Congress elected Gorbachev as president&nbsp;of the USSR. Gorbachev and his associates believed that he was now&nbsp;immune to the danger of a coup like the one that had deposed Nikita&nbsp;Khrushchev in 1964. Yet the presidency did not get the imprimatur of&nbsp;a universal ballot and was a weak institution. The army, the KGB and&nbsp;the police forces were under direct control of the president. At the same&nbsp;time, Gorbachev had to rule with the consent of a huge and inherently&nbsp;fractured parliamentary assembly.</p>
<p class="font16">In addition, Gorbachev began to lose control over economic and <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial processes. In the Soviet system, the Politburo and ultimately the general secretary controlled the State Bank, its </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial transactions and&nbsp;its issuing of currency, as well as caps on the state budget, foreign credits&nbsp;and domestic prices. In 1989, the Supreme Soviet assumed political control&nbsp;over the State Bank, and could now order new money to be issued, in&nbsp;competition with Gorbachev. Soviet bankers, who had been subject to&nbsp;Politburo pressure, now faced greater pressure from populist deputies,&nbsp;who demanded larger social payments to their constituencies and toyed&nbsp;irresponsibly with the slogans of demonopolization and deregulation of&nbsp;Soviet </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nances, in the false beliefthat these policies would bring freedom&nbsp;and prosperity for all.</span><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Rule by Congress and the Supreme Soviet undermined the union<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s executive powers and unleashed centrifugal and destructive forces. The Soviet legislature, ironically, became the platform not so much for anti-Soviet&nbsp;socialists, but rather for anti-communist and national-separatist factions.&nbsp;Soon this process moved with much greater intensity to the level of the&nbsp;republics: The institutions built by Stalin under tight party control turned&nbsp;into vehicles of national mobilization.</span></p>

They claimed that ethnic mobilization&nbsp;was a universal and inevitable reaction to the crisis ofany Soviet-type society&nbsp;and economy. They also wrote about the stabilization ofnationalist clienteles&nbsp;in Soviet republics during the reign of Leonid Brezhnev. The Leninist-Stalinist model ofthe state, sometimes called the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">af</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rmative action empire,</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">could not sustain the twin pressures of economic crisis and political&nbsp;liberalization.</span><span class="font2"><sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">This line ofargument has much merit and stands up well to scrutiny. Did Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership underestimate the danger of national&nbsp;separatism?

From 1988 onward ethnic tensions, violence and territorial&nbsp;disputes swept through the south Caucasus. The greatest challenge for&nbsp;Soviet statehood, however, were the strong national movements in the&nbsp;Baltic republics, demanding the acknowledgement and annulment of their&nbsp;forced annexation by Stalin in 1940. In 1989, with the creation of new&nbsp;representative institutions, national separatism in Lithuania, Latvia and&nbsp;Estonia became institutionalized. The majority ofethnic communists joined&nbsp;the movement toward secession, still masked by the slogans of greater&nbsp;economic and political autonomy. From the end of 1989 onward, the secessionist momentum in the Baltic states became an overt challenge to Soviet&nbsp;statehood and Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s political authority.</span></p>

In the Leninist-Stalinist design, this republic was to be&nbsp;permanently weakened, and at the same time serve as a backbone of the&nbsp;federated state. Stalin, especially after World War II, succeeded in convincing&nbsp;the Russians that they should play the role of an imperial </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">senior brother</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">and channel their resources into the construction of a superpower.

<p class="font16">It would be logical to assume, in accordance with classical theories of empire, that a growing Russian nationalism caused the Soviet empire to&nbsp;collapse.

As the Russian Federation declared its <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">sovereignty</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and its drift&nbsp;toward separatism began, Russian nationalists remained on the margins of&nbsp;this process.

<p class="font16">These forecasts turned upside down after the unexpected success of candidates with liberal-democratic and radical populist views in the elections&nbsp;ofMarch 1990, remarkably free and contested, to the Congress ofthe Russian&nbsp;Federation. All Russian nationalist advocates failed to seize the moment;&nbsp;their message was to defend the Soviet Union as an analogue ofRussia, and&nbsp;this did not cut the ice with the electorate. At the Congress, in late May, with&nbsp;a tiny margin, Boris Yeltsin was elected as the chairman of the Russian&nbsp;legislature. This rapid ascendancy of the former Politburo member meant&nbsp;a fantastic boost for the liberal anti-communists. At the same time, this was&nbsp;a step toward dual power in Moscow, because Yeltsin and Gorbachev were&nbsp;political enemies, divided by mutual hatred and contempt.</p>

<p class="font16">The Russian declaration ofsovereignty and <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">war oflaws</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">accelerated and empowered national separatism in the non-Russian republics. Yeltsin&nbsp;initiated a coalition against the union government with the leaders of&nbsp;Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The spectacle ofRussian radical democrats&nbsp;openly assailing Gorbachev in Moscow, in total de</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ance of the Soviet&nbsp;constitution, radicalized Baltic separatists: They began a campaign of civic&nbsp;resistance to the Soviet military, disrupted the military draft and demanded&nbsp;immediate independence. The anti-communist opposition in Moscow sided&nbsp;with Baltic nationalists, ignoring dangers of violence and the existence of&nbsp;Russian ethnic minorities in Baltic republics. One by one, Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s&nbsp;associates abandoned him and voiced their support for the liberal anticommunist movement and national separatists.</span></p>
<p class="font16">At the end of 1990 about one-fourth of the population in the Russian Federation began to think that the end of the union was <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">likely</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and even&nbsp;</span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">inevitable.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Frustrated by growing shortages of goods and by economic&nbsp;deterioration, an increasing number ofpeople became convinced that dissolving the USSR and establishing the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">independence of Russia</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">would be&nbsp;preconditions for economic reforms and recovery. As 1991 started, the KGB&nbsp;and other Soviet forces of </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">law and order</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">used force in Vilnius, andthenin&nbsp;Riga, seizing government buildings and television stations. Yeltsin seized the&nbsp;political moment, accusing Gorbachev of </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">bloodshed</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and calling for his&nbsp;resignation. February</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">March was the time when a descent into chaos and&nbsp;perhaps even a civil war became possibilities. The radical opposition also&nbsp;called for massive workers</span><span class="font17">' </span><span class="font16">strikes, which paralyzed the coal industry ofthe&nbsp;Russian Federation and Ukraine.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Struggling to boost the center<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s political legitimacy, Gorbachev pushed through the Congress of People</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s Deputies of the USSR a bill&nbsp;to hold an all-union referendum on the future of the Soviet Union.&nbsp;The reformed USSR was de</span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">ned as </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">a renovated federation of equal&nbsp;sovereign republics where the rights and freedoms of a person of any&nbsp;nationality will be fully guaranteed.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Gorbachev defended </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">the socialist&nbsp;choice</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and sharply criticized </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">so-called democrats</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">as </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">neo-Bolsheviks,</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">who wanted to bury the heritage of the Russian Revolution and restore&nbsp;capitalism in the country.</span></p>
<p class="font16">On 17 March 1991, 113.5 million people cast their vote, and 77.85 percent supported the idea of a reformed union; 22 percent voted against it.&nbsp;Gorbachev viewed the results as his victory, yet the referendum proved to</p>

<p class="font16">be another ofhis miscalculations. The three Baltic republics, plus Georgia, Armenia and Moldova, boycotted the referendum. Introducing the practice of national referendums in a situation when the old constitutional&nbsp;order was shaken to the core meant only an invitation to greater political&nbsp;chaos. The republican elites and opposition used this powerful tool of&nbsp;<span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">direct democracy</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">for their own political needs. In Ukraine, the referendum included a question about Ukrainian independence, and many&nbsp;people in western parts of the republic voted in favor. And the Russian&nbsp;Supreme Soviet decreed another referendum, also on 17 March, to create&nbsp;a new post ofthe president ofthe Russian Federation, elected by a direct&nbsp;national ballot within the RSFSR. The overwhelming majority of voters&nbsp;approved it. It was obvious that in open elections Yeltsin would have&nbsp;a good chance of winning. Jack Matlock, the US ambassador in Moscow,&nbsp;recorded his verdict: </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">Gorbachev had unwittingly set a trap for himself</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">and Yeltsin </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">sprang it.</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup></span></p>

Instead, Gorbachev willingly dismantled, step by&nbsp;step, the political dictatorship of the communist party, the main system&nbsp;ofpower in the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping in China called Gorbachev </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">a&nbsp;fool,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">yet such a choice appealed to Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s messianic, idealistic self.&nbsp;He viewed his </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">perestroika</span><span class="font16"> as an example to the world, as the return ofthe&nbsp;Soviet Union to the central stage of world affairs. In 1989 he advanced an&nbsp;ambitious project of a </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">common European home</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font16">; it had some geopolitical elements, but above all it was an idealistic vision ofa reformed Soviet&nbsp;Union accepted by the United States and other Western powers as an&nbsp;equal, and participating on respectable terms in the global economic&nbsp;system. To the end of his days in the Kremlin and many years later,&nbsp;Gorbachev claimed that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">perestroika</span><span class="font16"> was a unique historical chance to&nbsp;build a fair and peaceful global order, based on social-democratic and&nbsp;other </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">all-human</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">values; he subsequently reproached the United States&nbsp;for missing this chance and pursuing other priorities, at the expense ofthe&nbsp;Soviet Union and later Russia.</span><span class="font2"><sup>14</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">Some would say that, without his optimistic ego and supreme selfcon<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">dence, Gorbachev would have given up psychologically much earlier, under the pressure of the hardliners or the separatists in the republics.&nbsp;At the same time, Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s personality, with his preference for consensus over authoritarian rule, as well as his loyalty to the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">socialist choice</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">made him cling to the illusion that the CPSU could be reformed into some&nbsp;kind ofsocial-democratic party, a vehicle for electoral politics.

<p class="font16">hemmed in and hugely unpopular; short ofa brutal use offorce, he had no political capacity to act decisively. Some scholars, then and later, argued&nbsp;that Gorbachev made a mistake in not breaking with the party and in not&nbsp;running for presidency in open elections. Such a proposition, however,&nbsp;would have carried enormous risks, and not just to Gorbachev himself;&nbsp;moderate liberal reformers felt this could end up in a violent&nbsp;disintegration.<span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font16">Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s domestic popularity was already in drastic&nbsp;decline, and there was no guarantee that he would be elected, particularly&nbsp;against Boris Yeltsin.</span></p>
<p class="font16">In the spring of 1991, the personal duel between Yeltsin and Gorbachev embodied a profound realignment in the Russian Federation; the outcome&nbsp;of this realignment, as everyone recognized, would be either prolonging&nbsp;the life of the Soviet Union or ending it. Many of Yeltsin<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s supporters,&nbsp;among them a great number of intellectuals and people working for the&nbsp;media, imagined what happened as a struggle between </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">forces offreedom&nbsp;and democracy</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">on the one hand, and </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">the totalitarian state</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">on the other.&nbsp;This was the core of the movement. In reality, the deepening economic&nbsp;crisis created a strong countercurrent: An increasing number of people&nbsp;began to turn away from parliamentary institutions and pinned their hopes&nbsp;on a future strong, authoritarian leader who would </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">x the catastrophic&nbsp;economic situation. Both currents favored Yeltsin and disadvantaged&nbsp;Gorbachev. While anti-communism, in its liberal and authoritarian facets,&nbsp;kept growing, the communist party began to disintegrate and break up into&nbsp;factions. Smarter apparatchiks realized that the game was up and made&nbsp;strategic choices. Instead of waging a political struggle for power, they&nbsp;defected from it into business and other activities. They became engaged in&nbsp;what Steven L.

And the average Russian&nbsp;regarded him simply as a weak, inept leader.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Seeking to protect himself against a potential revolt of the hardliners at the April plenum of the CPSU, Gorbachev made a sudden move in the&nbsp;opposite direction: He invited Yeltsin and the leaders ofeight other republics&nbsp;(with six republics abstaining) to agree on the terms ofa new union treaty.&nbsp;This move caught the hardliners by surprise: They did not dare to get rid of&nbsp;Gorbachev as their leader, which would have left them face to face with&nbsp;Yeltsin and the awful economic legacy of Gorbachev<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s reforms. At the same&nbsp;time, it was another step in the dismantling of the union. Gorbachev&nbsp;renounced both the option of presidential rule and the center</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s legal supremacy. He also, for the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst time, accepted the republican leaders as equal&nbsp;parties in the reform process. Liberal Russian parliamentarian Viktor Sheinis&nbsp;aptly noted that </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">nine-plus-one</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">talks brought the Soviet Union back to the&nbsp;initial drawing table, by implicitly acknowledging that the USSR formed by&nbsp;the treaty of 1922 was no longer viable.</span><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">After a month-long campaign, Yeltsin scored a landslide victory, becoming the <span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst popularly elected president of the Russian Federation:&nbsp;57 percent of voters chose him over four other candidates, all of them&nbsp;members of the communist party. Yeltsin</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s inauguration in the Kremlin&nbsp;was, in form and in substance, a clear break with communist and socialist&nbsp;traditions. At this point, Gorbachev decided on his biggest gamble: He&nbsp;made key concessions to Yeltsin and the Russian Federation in the draft&nbsp;union treaty, in exchange for Yeltsin</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s consent to sign it and to support&nbsp;Gorbachev in the forthcoming elections for the presidency of the union.&nbsp;Gorbachev set the date for the treaty</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s signing on 20 August, without even&nbsp;waiting for Ukraine to agree to it.</span></p>
<p class="font16">On 18 August, a conspiracy of senior government of<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">cials, led by KGB head Vladimir Kriuchkov, moved to prevent the signing of the treaty.&nbsp;On 19 August, they proclaimed the establishment of the State Committee&nbsp;on the Emergency Situation and introduced troops to Moscow.

<p class="font16">coup was a half-hearted affair, and none ofits participants had the guts to use force and shed blood. They left Gorbachev, vacationing in Crimea, under&nbsp;house arrest, but did not even try to detain Yeltsin. In the absence ofpolitical&nbsp;legitimacy (the formal leader of the GKChP, Vice-President Gennadii&nbsp;Yanaev, was a political lightweight), they probably hoped to work out&nbsp;a deal with Yeltsin and counted on his hatred ofGorbachev.<span class="font2"><sup>19</sup></span></p>

The CNN&nbsp;images ofYeltsin resisting the coup from the top ofthe tank made him a hero&nbsp;for Russians and in Western public opinion. The Russian president assumed,&nbsp;in Gorbachev</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s absence, the functions of the commander-in-chief and proclaimed himself de facto a supreme leader of the Soviet Union as well as&nbsp;Russia.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The leaders ofthe GKChP were dedicated communists, yet even they had no will to do what Lenin would have done without blinking an eye: They&nbsp;never dared to use force and spill blood. The denouement ofthe coup meant&nbsp;the collapse of the center and its governmental structures.

Yeltsin, with his enormous populist appeal among Russians,&nbsp;became another crucial factor in the drama of Soviet collapse.

<p class="font16">American policy continued to set parameters for Soviet devolution: radical economic reforms, but without use of force; respect by the center&nbsp;for national self-determination and democracy in the republics, but&nbsp;not aggressive nationalism. After the failure of the August <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">coup,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">the&nbsp;US government took a more proactive stance.

A more detailed look, however, reveals that the international&nbsp;context accelerated the Soviet crisis and disintegration.

<p class="font16">Unfortunately, the history of Soviet collapse continued to be in<span class="font2">fl</span><span class="font16">uenced by politics; reassessments of recent events became an exercise in crafting&nbsp;a past usable for purposes of current politics. During Yeltsin</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">rst state visit&nbsp;to the United States, speaking at a joint session of the US Congress&nbsp;in June 1992, the Russian leader praised the people of Russia, who had&nbsp;found the strength </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">to shake off the burden of the totalitarian system,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and&nbsp;praised President Bush and the American people </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">for their invaluable moral&nbsp;support.</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font2"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font16">This interpretation of the Soviet collapse, however, did not&nbsp;remain dominant for long.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The primary reason for this change was the series of radical economic reforms after January 1991, called <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">the Gaidar revolution.</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">Its designers&nbsp;claimed that the main political purpose of reforms was to prevent a return&nbsp;to power of communism and its agents by creating a </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial and economic&nbsp;oligarchy. The argument that the Gaidar reforms were the only way to make&nbsp;a comeback of communist dictatorship impossible is a counterfactual&nbsp;that one cannot prove or refute. It is evident, however, that the transition&nbsp;undermined the </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nancial and social bases for liberal reforms in Russia </span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">privatization and the destruction of state programs weakened the same&nbsp;state-funded </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">Soviet intelligentsia</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">that had backed Yeltsin and the liberal&nbsp;anti-communist opposition against Gorbachev in 1991.</span></p>
<p class="font16">At the same time, the conservative-nationalist opposition emerged, sometimes drawn from the same social groups. In October 1993, Yeltsin had to use tanks against this opposition and its institutional center, the Supreme Soviet&nbsp;of the Russian Federation. Yeltsin<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s political ratings continued to plummet&nbsp;to single-digit numbers. The war in Chechnya he launched in December 1994&nbsp;did not help him either. He was reelected in 1996 due only to massive use&nbsp;of money, political manipulation and skillful political maneuvering.&nbsp;The elections showed that the majority of Russian people were bitterly&nbsp;disillusioned with the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">democratic regime.</span><span class="font17">”</span></p>

<p class="font16">The majority did not want to return to the communist past and did not subscribe to any kind of Marxism-Leninism. Still, enormous nostalgia for&nbsp;Soviet times spread. Memories about the Soviet collapse changed rapidly&nbsp;with post-Soviet economic and political realities. In Russia, the communist&nbsp;party quickly recovered and received impressive support from voters in the&nbsp;Duma elections of 1993; a communist candidate competed against Yeltsin in&nbsp;the presidential elections of 1996.</p>
<p class="font16">International developments contributed to the reassessment of Soviet collapse inside Russia. The Yeltsin government proclaimed the Russian&nbsp;Federation to be the legal successor of the Soviet Union and accepted all&nbsp;Soviet international obligations. The United States and other Western&nbsp;countries urged the Russian leadership to do so for their own reasons,&nbsp;because oftheir concern about international treaties signed by Gorbachev,&nbsp;Soviet-era debts, nuclear weapons and the stability of international institutions, such as the UN Supreme Council. In the second half of the 2000s,&nbsp;however, the Russian government and public opinion became frustrated&nbsp;with the post-Cold War architecture of European security and politics.&nbsp;Gorbachev<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">common European home</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">and Yeltsin</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s scheme for&nbsp;US</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">Russian partnerships came to naught. NATO</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s enlargement into&nbsp;Eastern Europe, its bombing in Yugoslavia and </span><span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">nally the US invitation&nbsp;to Ukraine to join NATO eroded support for pro-Western foreign policy in&nbsp;Russia. The fringe opinion that the United States always wanted to destroy&nbsp;the Soviet Union and sought to weaken Russia became dominant under the&nbsp;administration of Vladimir Putin. The second Russian president publicly&nbsp;declared that the Soviet collapse was </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">the greatest geopolitical catastrophe</span><span class="font17">”&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">ofthe past century.</span><span class="font2"><sup>26</sup></span></p>
<p class="font16">The politics of history is not limited to the former protagonists in the Cold War. In China, scholars of the Soviet Union, mostly working in the&nbsp;party-related institutes, studied the Soviet collapse carefully and drew&nbsp;lessons that pointed to the dangers of political liberalization. Most&nbsp;certainly the impact of Soviet events remains a potent reason why the&nbsp;CCP leadership keeps under tight control all instruments of repression,&nbsp;especially the army.</p>

<p class="font16">Almost nobody, at least until 1990, predicted that reforms and instability could lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union ceased&nbsp;to exist, however, there were suddenly many con<span class="font2">fi</span><span class="font16">dent explanations of its&nbsp;denouement. The discussion of why the communist regime ended became&nbsp;a contested concept, with many competing claims. In Western historiography, the dominant approach draws on the theories of nationalism and&nbsp;decolonization, and this chapter addresses the arguments of this approach,&nbsp;especially in the work of Mark Beissinger. Another approach, one that focuses&nbsp;on the evolution and decomposition of communism per se, its ideology,&nbsp;political and cultural institutions, trails behind in importance, and focuses&nbsp;primarily on the personality of Mikhail Gorbachev and his reforms. It is&nbsp;pioneered by the work of Archie Brown, such as </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">Did Gorbachev as General&nbsp;Secretary Become a Social Democrat?,</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Asia Studies</span><span class="font16"> 65, 2 (Mar. 2013),&nbsp;198</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">220. Finally, a relatively new approach, crosscutting cultural history and&nbsp;social anthropology, deemphasizes the political and ideological binaries of&nbsp;communism and anti-communism, and draws on postmodernist theories to&nbsp;explain the sudden dissolution of Soviet power. This approach can be found&nbsp;in Berkeley anthropologist Alexei Yurchak</span><span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Everything Was Forever,&nbsp;Until It Was No More: The Last Soviet Generation</span><span class="font16"> (Princeton: Princeton&nbsp;University Press, 2006).</span></p>
<p class="font16">Many authors argue that the Soviet Union could not be reformed and <span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">saved</span><span class="font17">” </span><span class="font16">once the communist system and communist political&nbsp;regime were gone. A skeptic can and should challenge this approach.&nbsp;See Stephen F.

<p class="font16">The social history of the Soviet collapse still has to be written. The focus is on the behavior of Soviet communist elites (party <span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">nomenklatura</span><span class="font16">) and&nbsp;their role. The dominant argument is that they had </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">a run on the bank</span><span class="font17">”</span><span class="font16">:&nbsp;abandoning the Soviet communist regime and leaving its institutions&nbsp;crumbling.

<p class="font16">In post-Soviet countries, the historiography of the Soviet collapse has been shaped by politics.

The Yeltsin camp came up with its own interpretation, one not&nbsp;generous to Gorbachev.

In some other post-Soviet states, most&nbsp;notably Ukraine, the events of 1990</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">91 became part of the narrative of&nbsp;national tragedy, revival, and destruction of the </span><span class="font17">“</span><span class="font16">empire.</span><span class="font17">”</span></p>
<p class="font16">The end of the Soviet Union does not end the international history of communism. How could it be written without taking China<span class="font17">'</span><span class="font16">s evolution into&nbsp;account? The task for future scholarship is to place the Soviet developments&nbsp;of 1989</span><span class="font17">-</span><span class="font16">91 into a broader historical and international context. Among promising ways to do this is to study the impact of global consumerism on&nbsp;communist societies and to study economic transition from the centralized&nbsp;communist-type economies to market economies.</span></p>
