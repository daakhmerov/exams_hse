<p class="font35" style="text-align:center;">The population&nbsp;of Europe in&nbsp;the 20th&nbsp;century</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Data: </span><span class="font32">in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, governments understand well the importance of demography for social planning and increasingly&nbsp;rely on demographic research. </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Demography becomes a research&nbsp;domain on its own. </span><span class="font32">A growing distance between demography&nbsp;and history, sociology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Population growth in Europe:</span></p>
<p><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">203 mln in 1800, 408 mln in 1900, 675 mln in 1999</span></p>
<p class="font32">However, population growth was even more impressive on other continents: <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the share of Europe in world population decreased&nbsp;</span><span class="font32">1900 - about 19% of world population lived in Europe (25% if&nbsp;Russian empire is included)</span></p>
<p class="font32">1950 - about 14.9% (21% with the USSR)</p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">2000 - about 8.4% (11% with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus)</p><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">
<p class="font32">WWII affected first and foremost the countries of Central, East-Central and Eastern Europe:</p></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">
<p class="font32">The growth of European population was achieved <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">despite colossal human losses in the two World Wars:</span></p></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">
<p class="font32">WWI (death toll in Europe, lowest estimation, Russia included):</p>
<p class="font32">7.7 million soldiers lost;</p>
<p class="font32">5-9 million civilians (mostly died not as a result of a direct military action but because of malnutrition and epidemics - Spanish flu of&nbsp;1918-19)</p></div><br clear="all"><div style="display:inline;layout-flow:horizontal;">
<p class="font32">WWII: (death toll in Europe, the USSR is not included):</p>
<p class="font32">6,7 million soldiers, 10.8 civilians (mostly victims of genocide and ^air-raids)</p>
<p class="font32">The USSR: 12 million soldiers, 13,6 million civilian deaths</p></div><br clear="all">
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 28pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">1950-2000: </span><span class="font32">no demographic catastrophes of the same magnitude.</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 28pt;">A steady population growth, <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">particularly pronounced in the 1950s - early 1960s.</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 28pt;">Later the pace of growth slowed down. In the late 20<sup>th </sup>century demographic problems (very <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">low fertility) </span><span class="font32">became&nbsp;apparent in Germany, Spain, Italy and many countries of&nbsp;Eastern, Central and South-Eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 28pt;">However, <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">in Western Europe it was partially compensated by immigration, </span><span class="font32">while in the countries of </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the Soviet block&nbsp;low fertility was also complemented by high mortality&nbsp;</span><span class="font32">(Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania) - </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the population started&nbsp;declining.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 34pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">Fertility (birth rates):</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 34pt;">• Fertility in Europe was <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">declining. By&nbsp;the late 20<sup>th</sup> century&nbsp;</span><span class="font33">in most countries of&nbsp;Europe, </span><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">fertility&nbsp;dropped to below-replacement level.</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">Fluctuations: already in the interwar decades, fertility decreased below the net reproduction level in some Western European&nbsp;countries. A new sharp decline in the fertility rates in the West:&nbsp;the late 1960s-1970s. By 1975 fertility dropped below the level&nbsp;necessary for net reproduction in almost all Western European&nbsp;countries (in Sweden in 1968, in Denmark in 1969, in West&nbsp;Germany - 1970).</p>
<p class="font33" style="padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 0pt;">However, in certain periods and countries the declining tendency discontinued for a few years. Apart from shortterm fluctuations, there was <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">a longer, one and a half&nbsp;decade period of rising fertility in the 1950s-mid-l 960s - ’the&nbsp;baby boom'.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">The ‘baby-boom' held out much longer and was on a larger scale&nbsp;than would be possible if its sole&nbsp;reason had been the usual rise in&nbsp;fertility after the war. Moreover, <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it&nbsp;ended abruptly around 1964,&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">followed by a marked decline in&nbsp;fertility, intensified in the early&nbsp;1970s.</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="padding:0pt 0pt 29pt 23pt;">• With the course of time, <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">differences between countries in Western and Southern Europe diminished, while in East-Central Europe fluctuations in fertility remained&nbsp;substantial, </span><span class="font33">and that did not allow to discern any&nbsp;patterns in this region.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">At the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>,h</sup> centuries, Austria, Germany and Ireland had the highest birth rates, and family size was the smallest in France.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;"> By the late 1980s, it was not only Ireland but also Norway, the UK and France that had the highest fertility, while the lowest fertility was&nbsp;observed in West Germany and Austria. Thus, <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">France moved from the&nbsp;group with very low fertility to the group with high fertility rates, </span><span class="font6">while&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy and Spain - the countries with high fertility for the most part of&nbsp;the 20<sup>th</sup> century, shifted to the group with the lowest fertility </span><span class="font6">in the&nbsp;early 21<sup>st</sup> century.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">In <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">East Central Europe and the Balkans in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, </span><span class="font6">fertility was very high by European standards. However </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">after WWII these&nbsp;countries showed remarkably different paths of development.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">Unlike in most countries of WE and North America, <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">there was no baby-boom in the region in the mid-1950s-mid-l 960s - instead there were substantial oscillations in fertility rates, </span><span class="font6">which could be linked to&nbsp;constantly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">changing social policies. (Criminalization of abortion </span><span class="font6">in&nbsp;Hungary in 1953 - did not last long, in Rumania in the mid-1960s - yet&nbsp;the population soon started relying on other methods of birth-control).</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">Hungary had average fertility rates (average for Western Europe), while Poland till the late 1980s had very high birth rates (only Ireland and&nbsp;South-Eastern Europe had even higher figures).</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the 1990s, the region again showed some similarity: fertility rates were dropping down fast </span><span class="font6">in all countries of the former Soviet block, with&nbsp;exception of Albania.</span></p>
<p style="padding:38pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">The causes of changing fertility rates </span><span class="font33">-a number of demographic, socio-economic and cultural factors.&nbsp;Similar trends can be caused by very different factors.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font33">• The <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">decline of infant and child mortality;</span></p></li><li>
<p><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">• Urbanisation</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font33">Indirect effect of these factors</p>
<p class="font33">Exceptions: in Italy in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century female employment was the lowest in Europe, at the same&nbsp;time fertility rates were also very low.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Economic theories of fertility </span><span class="font32">maintain that </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the family size is conditioned by a household’s drive to maximise satisfaction by&nbsp;balancing the benefits against the costs of children.</span></p>
<p class="font32">In the 20<sup>th</sup> century <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the costs of child-rearing increased and the economic benefits declined </span><span class="font32">for a number of reasons:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 18pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the decline of agriculture and self-employment, legal restrictions on child labour,&nbsp;compulsory education,</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 18pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">rising housing and educational standards and costs, growing female employment </span><span class="font32">-rising costs of the time of&nbsp;women.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultural factors - individualisation and secularisation.</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">Philippe Aries: parents from the 1960s on are less and less willing to organize their lives around their children and try to arrange their&nbsp;affairs so that it would happen the other way round, i.e, they&nbsp;organize child-rearing around their lives.</p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">The weakening of religious values, as well as the identification with other traditional institutions of society.</p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">These structural explanations <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">could be applied to East-Central Europe and the Balkans in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, even declining fertility&nbsp;in the region in the mid-1950s-1960s. </span><span class="font32">It was the period when </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;region experienced a significant reduction of population&nbsp;employed in agriculture - </span><span class="font32">the group that was primarily responsible&nbsp;for very high birth rates in earlier periods.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:17pt;padding:0pt 0pt 34pt 0pt;"><span class="font34" style="font-weight:bold;">Mortality</span></p>
<p class="font34" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 17pt;">•Significantly <span class="font34" style="font-weight:bold;">decreased </span><span class="font34">everywhere, however with </span><span class="font34" style="font-weight:bold;">regionally diverging dynamics.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">In the early 20th century the lowest mortality rates were observed in&nbsp;Scandinavia (even there an&nbsp;average life expectancy for men&nbsp;at birth was just about 50 y/o).</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">By the late 1980s in all countries of WE it exceeded 70 y/o and in&nbsp;Norway and Sweden approached&nbsp;75.</p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">Among <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">women </span><span class="font32">life expectancy increased even more: by 1990 in WE average life expectancy for women was 6.5 years more&nbsp;than for men.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">The longer life span of women is a modern phenomenon, </span><span class="font32">which could be observed in certain parts of Europe (Switzerland,&nbsp;Sweden) already at the end of the eighteenth century. </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">In the&nbsp;early twentieth century, the gap was about 2- 3 years generally,&nbsp;but then it began to widen. </span><span class="font32">By 1990, even the narrowest gap&nbsp;amounted to 5.5 years (Ireland).</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">Nevertheless, <span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">from the 1980s on, the growth of the gap between male and female mortality slowed down, </span><span class="font32">and in a few countries,&nbsp;a moderate process of levelling off began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">Infant mortality </span><span class="font32">(babies younger than 1 y/o) - </span><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">the most important contributor to mortality improvement. Improved all through the 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century:</span></p>
<p class="font32" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">in 1900 in Germany infant mortality was about 20%, in Sweden and Norway - just a bit lower than 10%. By the late 1980s in WE it was&nbsp;<span class="font18">10s </span><span class="font32">0.9% (9 babies per 1000).</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font31" style="font-weight:bold;">The decline of infant mortality was particularly visible between 1950 and 1990, </span><span class="font32">when it decline 4 times.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 14pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">East Central Europe and especially the Balkans </span><span class="font33">were </span><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">lagging </span><span class="font33">behind through the whole 20th century.</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 14pt;">The decline of mortality in the region was particularly <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">significant in the 1950s- the first half of the 1960s. </span><span class="font33">Internal&nbsp;mortality differences in the countries of the region&nbsp;moderated and Czechoslovakia and Hungary caught&nbsp;up with several Western European countries.</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 14pt;">However <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">from the mid-1960s the figures for mortality in the region began to stagnate or deteriorate. </span><span class="font33">This was the&nbsp;commencement of </span><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">strong divergence in mortality&nbsp;between Eastern and Western European trends, </span><span class="font33">which&nbsp;was further </span><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">strengthened by the rapid unification within&nbsp;Western Europe in the 1980s and the post-communist&nbsp;’transition period'</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">The change did not affect every country, age group, social class and gender in the same way. <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">Women’s mortality rates&nbsp;turned relatively favourably, the mortality gap between the&nbsp;sexes was wider </span><span class="font33">in East Central Europe than in most of the&nbsp;countries of Western Europe: 9 years when considering life&nbsp;expectancies in Poland in 1990.</span></p>
<p class="font33">Age and social differences also prevailed. <span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">In all communist countries, the deterioration of mortality affected middle-aged&nbsp;working-class males the most.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:15pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;"><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Causes of mortality changes:</span></p>
<p class="font5">The role of <span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">medical science and technology. </span><span class="font5">Highly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">debatable </span><span class="font5">issue.</span></p>
<p class="font5" style="padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;">Yet most authors suggest that even in the most advanced countries of Europe <span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">medicine starts playing a decisive role only in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. </span><span class="font5">For most&nbsp;infectious diseases, mortality had begun to decline before medicine could have cured&nbsp;or prevented them through vaccination, which can be explained by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">belter living&nbsp;conditions, and most importantly by improving nutrition. Tuberculosis </span><span class="font5">-largely&nbsp;eradicated in Western Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, even though its&nbsp;treatment became available only after World War II.</span></p>
<p class="font5">^Accessibility of information. The rising levels of education.</p>
<p class="font5">•A change in attitudes to infants and children.</p>
<p class="font5">•Better working conditions. Improved conditions of housing.</p>
<p class="font5" style="padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;">•Sanitation measures of municipal and central governments - building sewage systems, the provision of clean drinking water and control over the sale of food products -effects as early as the first decades of the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="font5" style="padding:0pt 0pt 18pt 0pt;">In the second half of the 20“ century health care became accessible practically to the whole society and thus medical innovations made possible by technical advancement&nbsp;benefited the masses.</p>
<p style="text-indent:8pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">The epidemiological transition:</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="text-indent:8pt;">a historic shift in the nature of fatal diseases.</p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">Early modern period - the ‘age of pestilence and famine’, The 19<sup>th</sup> century - the ‘age of receding pandemics’, </span><span class="font33">which&nbsp;remained predominant by the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. </span><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">Infectious&nbsp;diseases as well as maladies of the digestive and the&nbsp;respiratory organs </span><span class="font33">(e,g. pneumonia) were the leading&nbsp;causes of death.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 28pt 8pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">The 20<sup>th</sup> century - the ‘age of degenerative and man-made diseases’ </span><span class="font33">- cardiovascular and cancerous conditions and&nbsp;other types of degenerative health problems caused by&nbsp;human activity as the principal causes of death.</span></p>
<p class="font33" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 14pt 8pt;">In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century these diseases cause 1 /5 of deaths in developed European countries, by the late 20<sup>th</sup> century-<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;"><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">Migration</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">European overseas emigration</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The migration of Europeans to other continents: maximum between 1881 and 1910. </span><span class="font6">1.3 million people annually left Europe in the early 20* century. 27 million&nbsp;people left Europe between 1891 and 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Emigration spread from west to east:</span></p>
<p class="font6">In the mid-19* century, emigrants were mostly from the <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">British Isles,</span></p>
<p class="font6">0ter - from <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany and Scandinavia</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">by the turn of the 20th century - from <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern and East Central Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Between 1890 and 1910, the main target of emigration - the United States </span><span class="font6">(58% of European overseas emigrants went to the US).</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;">Other important destinations in the late 19* - early 20* century - Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;">Many Europeans moved to the colonies as <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">civil servants, soldiers or engineers (hoping to return </span><span class="font6">to Europe upon retirement).</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 29pt;">•The belligerent parties hindering both the emigration of their men of military age and the movement of citizens from enemy countries.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 29pt;">•The war made sea travel, and thus migration, difficult to manage and often even dangerous.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 29pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After WWI - the migration of Europeans did not return to pre-war levels.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:29pt;">Several reasons for that:</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 61pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1921, the United States introduced restrictions on immigration </span><span class="font6">(in order to reduce the total number of immigrants and to control their&nbsp;ethnic composition):</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 61pt;">a 3% quota for each ethnic immigrant group (total number of immigrants from a particular ethnic group already resident in the UK&nbsp;as 100%).</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 61pt;">In 1924 the quota restricted to 2%.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 61pt;">These measures aimed at the reduction of Asian immigration, but they also <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hindered Southern and Eastern European arrivals&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">(because these regions had just started sending immigrants to the&nbsp;US, which meant a low quota set for them).</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 61pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Depression - </span><span class="font6">made difficult to find a job in the US.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 61pt;">Thus, in the 1920s, on the average, 700 000 people per annum left Europe for overseas destinations, and this figure dropped to 130 000&nbsp;in the 1930s. <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The US remained the most important destination </span><span class="font6">for&nbsp;overseas migration.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 36pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">After WWII: a new increase in European overseas migration. </span><span class="font6">Half a million annually between 1946 and 1960.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 36pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">However, the significance of overseas migration was gradually weakening:</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:36pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">•The strict restrictions on emigration in communist countries.</p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 36pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">•A positive migration balance of Europe since the mid-1960s </span><span class="font6">(more people arrive to Europe than leave it). </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The independence of former&nbsp;colonies </span><span class="font6">induced a notable flow of repatriation (Frenchmen from&nbsp;Algeria, Britons from African and Asian colonies, Dutch from Indonesia&nbsp;and, in the 1970s, Portuguese from Africa). The persistence of strong&nbsp;economic, cultural and political ties with the farmer colonies, and&nbsp;humanitarian considerations - contributed to overseas immigration into&nbsp;Western European countries from the 1960s.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">European immigration: flows induced by political factors:</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">Compared to the 19* century, <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the proportion of migration flows caused by wars and political factors greatly increased in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WWI and post-WWI </span><span class="font6">peace treaties, which included the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">resettlement of ethnic minorities:</span></p>
<p class="font6">1 million Germans forced to leave Poland and Alsace</p>
<p class="font6">900000 Poles moved from Russia to Poland. About 1 million emigrated Russia during the civil war.</p>
<p class="font6">A flow of Armenian refugees from Turkey.</p>
<p class="font6">The Lausanne peace treaty: 1.35 million Greeks leave Turkey, 420 000 Turks leave Greece.</p>
<p class="font6">A similar population exchange between Greece and Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">500 000 Hungarians leave territories annexed by the successor states of the AustroJHujiggrign empire and settle in Hungary.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">In the 1930s, 300 000 fled Spain as a consequence of the civil war.</p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Population flows induced by WWII:</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">•Deportation and extermination of Jews: about 5.6-5.9 million.</p>
<p class="font6">•Workers coming over to the Third Reich. In 1944 - 7.8 million foreign workers, forced labourers and prisoners of war in Germany = almost one-third of the total&nbsp;work force.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">From the Netherlands, Belgium or France - voluntarily, attracted by higher wages; <span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font6"> Eastern Europe most often recruited by force.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">•In the last stage of the war, several million civilians fleeing East Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania and other Eastern German territories to the West.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At the end of WWII: about 40 million refugees registered in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 35pt;">Between 1945 and 1950 7.5 million <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Germans </span><span class="font6">were systematically relocated from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania. Most of them&nbsp;ended up in West Germany. The 1950 West German census showed&nbsp;that 19% of the population consisted of refugees or emigrants. In 1960&nbsp;- 24% (the East German emigrants).</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 35pt;">A population exchange was also initiated at the Potsdam Conference between <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Czechoslovakia and Hungary; Yugoslavia and Hungary; and&nbsp;the Soviet Union and Romania.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:35pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;">3 million <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Poles </span><span class="font6">relocated to Poland from the USSR.</span></p>

<p class="font6" style="text-indent:8pt;">A large number of them - <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Germans:</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:31pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">The Potsdam treaty ensured freedom of movement between the Eastern and Western sectors of Berlin - until the building of the Berlin Wall in 1<span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">961 -3.58 million moved from East Germany to the West, </span><span class="font6">whereas 0.5 million&nbsp;moved in the opposite direction).</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:31pt;padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 8pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2.8 million Germans left Eastern Europe - </span><span class="font6">the largest numbers came from Poland, the Soviet Union and Romania.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">In 1956- early 1957, about 194 000 emigrated from <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Hungary</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 8pt;">In 1968-69 160 000 refugees from <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Czechoslovakia</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 8pt;">In 1980-81 250 000 refugees from <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Poland.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 8pt;">In the 1990s: East Germans emigrating to Western regions of Germany; <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4 million refugees with the disintegration of Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:19pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">European immigration: economically motivated flows</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 19pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the early 20<sup>,h</sup> century - few restrictions on the movement of labour within Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 19pt;">950 000 <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">foreign workers in Germany </span><span class="font6">(mostly Poles and Italians). Many foreign workers in France. The highest ratio of foreign labourers in proportion to the&nbsp;country's population - in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Switzerland </span><span class="font6">(600,000 people, mostly Germans, Italians&nbsp;and Spaniards).</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:19pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Between WWI and WWII: the movement of labour slowed down.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 19pt;">Bureaucratic rules made crossing borders more difficult than before World War I (minor obstacles compared with the restrictions after the Second World War).&nbsp;<span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Depression with enormous unemployment.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 19pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">France </span><span class="font6">was the only country to receive a significant flow within Europe (for some time, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the number-one migration target in the world): </span><span class="font6">almost 2 million&nbsp;foreign workers arriving to France between 1920 -1930.</span></p>
<p class="font6">The fast economic development after the Second World War. <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Migration within Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font6">In the 1950s - mostly <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Italians </span><span class="font6">who went abroad to work</span></p>
<p class="font6">From the 1960s, <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Spaniards, Portuguese, Greeks, Yugoslavians and Turks </span><span class="font6">joining the movement.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The peak in 1973, </span><span class="font6">7.5 million guest workers employed in the 9 countries of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Free Trade&nbsp;Association (EFTA) countries. The major host countries: Germany (2.5 million -12% of German labour force), France (2.3 million - 10% of French Iqbgyr force)&nbsp;and Switzerland (0.6 million).</span></p>
<p class="font6">The economic recession induced by the oil crisis (1972) - a plunge in the number of guest workers.</p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Changes in the countries of origin and internal composition of immigrants </span><span class="font6">in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1970s-1980s:</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">Instead of Italians, Spaniards, Greeks - <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese, Yugoslavians, Moroccans, Algerians, Turks.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A shift from temporary or returning to permanent migration </span><span class="font6">(instead of primarily young and single men who intended to stay only for a few years to&nbsp;collect capital with which to start a family and a small business back in their&nbsp;home country- a chain migration = family members, relatives and even&nbsp;friends joining the guest workers, children born in the host country).</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By the 1990s, </span><span class="font6">another factor made the integration of the immigrants more difficult: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">migrants coming from an ever-growing number of countries and in&nbsp;ever-increasing numbers from regions outside Europe. </span><span class="font6">Western European&nbsp;countries admitting refugees because of humanitarian considerations (from&nbsp;war zones, authoritarian regimes).</span></p>
<p class="font6">Between 1983 and 1992 Germany gave asylum to 1.4 million people alone. In 1994 in Germany, 28% of foreigners were Turkish and only 22% came from&nbsp;the European Union (EU).</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;">In the early 1990s, 36% of immigrants in France were European (mostly Portuguese), whereas 39% came from the Maghreb countries.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 0pt;">In the early 1990s, 49% of immigrants living in the EU arrived from outside Europe.</p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 21pt;">As a result from the 1960s, <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the ratio of the foreign population had been rising significantly in every Western European country: </span><span class="font6">by 1995 - 9.0% in&nbsp;Belgium, 8.8% in Germany, 3.4% in Great Britain, 4.7% in the Netherlands,&nbsp;8.5% in Austria, 5.2% in Sweden and 18.9% in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 21pt;">Note that 1) data on the ratio of the foreign population include <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">legal immigrants only </span><span class="font6">(the number of illegal immigrants estimated around 2&nbsp;million in Western Europe); 2) in certain countries, immigrants may obtain&nbsp;citizenship quickly, while in other countries, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">naturalization </span><span class="font6">is a more&nbsp;complicated process. Eg..: the high ratio of the foreign population in&nbsp;Switzerland originates from the frequent lack of Swiss citizenship even in the&nbsp;third-generation descendants of the immigrants.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 20pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Eastern Europe: </span><span class="font6">the guest worker movement on a very low scale, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">except tor Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p class="font6" style="padding:0pt 0pt 20pt 20pt;">Allowing citizens to take Western European jobs would have presented an obstacle to the <span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">maintenance of state monopolies on foreign currency; </span><span class="font6">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">shortage of labour.. </span><span class="font6">Obstacles to the reception of guest workers - </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the low level&nbsp;of wages and the lack of the convertibility of currencies.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 20pt;"><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The GDR, </span><span class="font6">suffering from extreme shortage of labour because of large-scale emigration, employed guest workers from other socialist countries - on the&nbsp;basis of bilateral agreements, with a strict rotation scheme of workers (a few&nbsp;tens of thousands at a time) - from Poland and Hungary, the 1980s, mostly&nbsp;from Metnam, Cuba and Mozambique.</span></p>
<p class="font30" style="text-indent:2pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 121pt;">Families and households in the 20th century</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 45pt 0pt;"><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Marriage patterns</span></p>
<h2><a name="caption1"></a><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>The Hajnal model - remained valid at least until the middle of the 20</span><span class="font34" style="font-weight:bold;">th </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">century:</span></h2>
<p class="font23" style="padding:0pt 0pt 43pt 0pt;">around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the average age at which people entered their first marriage all over Western Europe was circa 28 years for men and&nbsp;26 for women = high when compared with the societies in East Central and&nbsp;South-Eastern Europe. This pattern persisted even in the interwar period.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 43pt 0pt;"><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">However, in Western Europe between 1950 and 1970, the average age at first marriage decreased significantly: </span><span class="font23">by 2- 3 years for men and by 34 years for women. Another signal of the renaissance of marriage and&nbsp;family (the sudden rise of birth rates = </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the ‘baby boom' was the other&nbsp;signal).</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 44pt 0pt;"><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Then, from the mid-1970s, the age at first marriage rapidly increased again, and by the late 1980s, the Western European mean was at the&nbsp;same level as in the early 20</span><span class="font34" style="font-weight:bold;">th </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">century.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 74pt;"><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Lifelong celibacy in Western Europe</span></p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 43pt 74pt;">= the ratio of those never married in the cohort of 45- 54-ye avoids: In 1900 8% - 28% <span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">for men and 10% </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">- </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">24% for women </span><span class="font23">(the lowest&nbsp;levels in Germany and the highest ones in Ireland).</span></p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 74pt;">In the 20<span class="font34">th </span><span class="font23">century the rate of lifelong singles declined (for men - in 1900-1950, for women - after 1950). By 1990 female celibacy&nbsp;dropped below male rates (men - 10.7%; women -7.1%).</span></p>

<p class="font23" style="text-indent:2pt;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 24pt;">Ca. 1900: marriage was entered at a younger age and was almost universal</p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:2pt;padding:0pt 0pt 45pt 24pt;">Before WWII: Hajnal'.s Eastern European marriage pattern faded in East Central Europe, yet no marked change in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:2pt;padding:0pt 0pt 45pt 24pt;">After World War <span class="font22">II </span><span class="font23">- the ratio of lifelong singles dropped down, the average age of first marriage lowered (like in the West, the baby-boom),&nbsp;yet little or no decline from the late 1960s (unusual).

<p class="font23" style="text-indent:2pt;padding:0pt 0pt 45pt 24pt;">Still, until the 1990s, comparatively high ratio of married people and the young age at marriage <span class="font22">= </span><span class="font23">marriage had </span><span class="font22">a </span><span class="font23">monopoly in partnerships.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 95pt 0pt;"><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">Interpreting family formation patterns:</span></p>
<p class="font27" style="text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 48pt 0pt;">For the 20<sup>th</sup> century we <span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">need to explain two major phenomena:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font27" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 15pt;">1) the youthful marriage pattern and <span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">the near universality of&nbsp;marriage in the 1950s and 1960s </span><span class="font27">(the baby-boom period). The&nbsp;willingness to marry was greater in Western Europe in the two</span></p></li></ul>

<p class="font27" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 15pt;">decades after World War I! than was known at any time in history before;</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 48pt 15pt;"><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">2) the successive rise from the mid-1960s in the age at marriage&nbsp;and the growing popularity of alternative forms of living&nbsp;arrangements </span><span class="font27">in Western Europe (accompanied by declining&nbsp;fertility).</span></p></li></ul>
<h2 style="text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 41pt 0pt;"><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Factors affecting marriage strategies:</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font24" style="text-indent:11pt;">• value changes (individualization and secularization),</p></li><li>
<p class="font24" style="padding:0pt 0pt 41pt 38pt;">• the shifts in economic and employment structures (industrialization,&nbsp;urbanization, and the marked increase in female employment).</p></li></ul>
<p class="font24" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 45pt 11pt;">The decline in the age at marriage had already begun in the 1930s in several parts of Western Europe - linked to the emerging <span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">disequilibrium&nbsp;in the ratio of the sexes </span><span class="font24">(caused by migration, and war losses). The&nbsp;effects of these factors gained strength after World War II.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 11pt;"><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font24"><a name="bookmark7"></a>After WWII: </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">economic hardship and increased female employment </span><span class="font24">as unfavourable to family formation.</span></h2>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 41pt 11pt;"><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Unprecedented economic growth of the 1950s-early 1960s </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">- </span><span class="font24">an optimistic 'reconstruction sentiment’, which improved the willingness to&nbsp;marry.</span></p>
<p class="font26" style="padding:0pt 0pt 47pt 0pt;">From the mid-1960s - the resuming decline <span class="font28">in </span><span class="font26">marriage rates - as linked to the change </span><span class="font28">in </span><span class="font26">women's role in family and society: </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">legal emancipation&nbsp;and the diffusion of female employment and education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">An equalization of gender roles reduced the attractiveness of marriage from an economic standpoint: </span><span class="font26">the division of labour within&nbsp;the family </span><span class="font28">is </span><span class="font26">one of the advantages that marriage has over living on one’s&nbsp;pwn. Plus </span><span class="font28">a </span><span class="font26">growing popularity of unmarried cohabitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">Modern methods of birth control (the contraceptive pill </span><span class="font27">and intrauterine devices): lower fertility; encouraged cohabitation outside of&nbsp;marriage and affected the timing of marriages - </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">the lengthening of the&nbsp;phase of pre-mantal partnership and cohabitation</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 77pt;"><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">The Eastern half of Europe after World War </span><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;">II:</span></p>
<p class="font26" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 48pt 77pt;">Marriage becoming even more universal there than before - the result of the interplay of several factors.</p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 43pt 77pt;"><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">'Marriage as an institution of partnership was traditionally dominant </span><span class="font26">in the region. The isolation of socialist countries from&nbsp;the West inhibited or delayed any economic and social diffusion&nbsp;processes. Considerable social and cultural uniformity.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 43pt 77pt;"><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;">•A </span><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">relatively high degree of social security </span><span class="font26">made it possible to plan life's important events, such as marriage. Social policy&nbsp;prioritized married couples </span><span class="font28">in </span><span class="font26">the distribution of several&nbsp;services, most of all housing.</span></p>
<h2 style="padding:0pt 0pt 44pt 77pt;"><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Divorce and the pluralization of family forms:</span></h2>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 44pt 77pt;"><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Divorce law was varied </span><span class="font24">across Europe in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and diversity survived until the last third of the century.</span></p>
<p class="font24" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 77pt;">Finland abandoned the fault principle as the only grounds for divorce as early as 1917.</p>
<p class="font24" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 77pt;">In Italy - no legal possibility for the dissolution of marriages until 1970. Spain - divorce legalized only in 1982</p>
<p class="font24" style="padding:0pt 0pt 44pt 77pt;">Ireland - 1996 (after a referendum that approved the measure by 50.3%)</p>
<p class="font23" style="padding:0pt 0pt 42pt 0pt;">Wherever divorce was possible, the break-up of&nbsp;marriages multiplied&nbsp;manifold by the midcentury.</p>
<p class="font23" style="padding:0pt 0pt 42pt 0pt;">From the mid-1960s, the leading countries were&nbsp;Scandinavia and Great&nbsp;Britain</p>

<p class="font23" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 41pt 43pt;">Another important trend, common to Europe as a whole in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, - <span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">the separation of households from each other.</span></p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 41pt 43pt;">In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, even formally distinct households were often intertwined (e.g. a worker employed by his landlord and&nbsp;often also paying for his lodging with labour).</p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 46pt 43pt;">Budapest 1910: only 42.6% of households existed by themselves alone in one dwelling; the rest - lodgers, night&nbsp;lodgers or persons actually renting a part of the dwelling,</p>

<p class="font23" style="padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 55pt;">The spread of <span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">one-person households. </span><span class="font23">Caused by:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font34" style="padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 55pt;">• <span class="font23">the improvement in mortality plus expanding social welfare&nbsp;services -&gt; older people were less and less dependent on their&nbsp;relatives (women overrepresented);</span></p></li><li>
<p class="font34" style="padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 55pt;">• <span class="font23">In the 1960s, the number of young people, and especially young&nbsp;women, living alone rose -&gt; a special urban lifestyle. Stagnation&nbsp;(and even decline) in the 1970s- 1980s.</span></p></li></ul>
<p class="font34" style="padding:0pt 0pt 43pt 55pt;">• <span class="font23">After WWII and especially from the 1970s, booming divorce&nbsp;numbers -&gt; the ratio of singleparent families rose.</span></p>
<p class="font23" style="text-indent:3pt;padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 30pt;">This trend was far less important for East Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p style="text-indent:48pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 0pt;"><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Relationship between partners and attitudes towards children:</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:48pt;">1900-1950:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 48pt;">Families became more egalitarian, their rigid hierarchies (meaning, most of all, patriarchy) eased up. Child-rearing became the centre of family life.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 48pt;">Related to increased female employment, improved women’s wages and broader changes in the nature of women's jobs.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 48pt;">1900: Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries - 1/3 of employees were women; a in Germany, France, Belgium and Great Britain - around 30%.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 48pt;">Increase during WWI yet followed by decline after WWI.</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 48pt;">Uneven developments post WWII. <span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Scandinavian countries </span><span class="font18">had not been on top of the list in the immediate post-WWII decades but became the leaders in the late 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century. Through the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Europe and Ireland&nbsp;lagged behind </span><span class="font18">other Western European countries.</span></p>
<p class="font20" style="padding:0pt 0pt 36pt 85pt;">East Central and Eastern Europe:</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 33pt 85pt;">In the early 20th century and in the interwar period, female employment in the region fell in the middle range in a Western European comparison.</p>
<p class="font20" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 33pt 85pt;">Female employment rose rapidlyeven in an international comparison in the 1950s and 1960s. <span class="font18">As a result of this development in the 1960s, the socialist&nbsp;countries, and, most of all, </span><span class="font20">Poland and East Germany, were in the lead in&nbsp;Europe, with the Scandinavian countries.</span></p>
<p class="font20" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 85pt;">After the mid-1970s, the female employment gap closed somewhat between the countries of East Central and Western Europe, <span class="font18">because levels had reached&nbsp;their peak by then in the communist countries, although the upward trend&nbsp;continued in all Western European societies.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 78pt;"><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">The characteristics of female jobs also changed as </span><span class="font18">gender differences in education gradually faded.</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 78pt;"><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">From the 1950s, women's education levels rocketed throughout Europe and became particularly high in East Central Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 78pt;">In 1960, of the Western European countries, only Finland (46%), France (41%) and Sweden (33%) reached or surpassed the ratios found in Poland (35%),&nbsp;Czechoslovakia (34%i and Hungary (30%).</p>
<p class="font18" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 35pt 78pt;">Consequently, in East Central Europe, the ratio of women in several professions requiring high qualifications, such as teachers, approached or reached that of&nbsp;men's starting from the 1960s.</p>

<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 33pt 0pt;"><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Income and wealth distribution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Kuznets curve, </span><span class="font13">named after the Nobel laureate economist Simon Kuznets, shaped as an </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">inverted U = differences in income first increased&nbsp;in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, and then, in the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, began to&nbsp;decline in industrial societies. </span><span class="font13">(Simon Kuznets, 'Economic Growth and&nbsp;Income Inequality’, American Economic Review, vol. XLV (1995), no. 1,1-28).</span></p>
<p class="font13">WE, ca. 1900: <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the richest 10% of the population commanded 35-40% of the total income.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">Scandinavia, 1950: the richest 10% commanded <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">27- 29% of the total income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1950-2000 the process slowed down</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">West Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, 1970 - the top 10% commanded about 30% of incomes. (GB - a more moderate&nbsp;income concentration, whereas the lowest values - in Scandinavian&nbsp;countries and Austria).</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">However, <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">tendencies of levelling off have halted or even reversed in several European countries, beginning with the&nbsp;1970s and 1980s.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The strata with the lowest income:</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">Before 1929 their position <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">changed for the worse </span><span class="font13">= the middle strata may be&nbsp;regarded as the winners of the&nbsp;transformations.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The late 1950s till 1980s/1990s - </span><span class="font13">the income position of the poorest was&nbsp;generally </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">improving. </span><span class="font13">(Important: in&nbsp;the period of rapid economic growth&nbsp;after WWII, even the stagnation of the&nbsp;relative income position implied a&nbsp;considerable improvement in the&nbsp;standard of living).</span></p>
<p class="font13">In socialist countries, a tendency towards a fast levelling of incomes occurred after World War II.</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:11pt;padding:0pt 0pt 41pt 0pt;">1962, Czechoslovakia - the upper 10% of the population accounted for only 14% of the total personal income = the&nbsp;most egalitarian income distribution in Europe.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 11pt;">However, <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">from the 1970s </span><span class="font13">in the East Central European region,&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">income inequalities were on&nbsp;the rise again.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 11pt;">Distinct forms of inequalities emerged with regard to the&nbsp;<span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">access to consumer goods and&nbsp;services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">In the 1980s, Scandinavian countries </span><span class="font13">(and especially Finland) had </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the most egalitarian distribution of income </span><span class="font13">in Western and Southern&nbsp;Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Belgium and Luxembourg, followed by the Netherlands and West Germany - relatively small income differences characterized.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">Portugal, the United Kingdom, France and Italy - the medium group Spain, Switzerland and Ireland - highest inequalities.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">Remarkably, <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">at the end of the 1980s, it was not the communist countries any more that had the lowest income inequalities in Europe;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">it was the Scandinavian countries and notably Finland.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:13pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">In the <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1980s the decline in income differentials halted, </span><span class="font13">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">even turned to increase </span><span class="font13">again in several countries in Western Europe&nbsp;and overseas = as </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">'the great U-turn’.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The most marked changes occurred in the UK.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">After 1990, </span><span class="font13">a slight reduction of inequalities occurred in Western Europe, however </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the erosion of income equality in the postcommunist countries was dramatic.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">In the <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">United States, </span><span class="font13">starting from higher original levels, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the decline in income inequalities stopped around 1970, earlier than in&nbsp;Western Europe, then from the 1970s and 1980s inequalities&nbsp;increased at a higher rate than in any European country. </span><span class="font13">Only&nbsp;Ireland and Switzerland had income inequalities equalling that of the&nbsp;United States by 2000.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 28pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Changes in wealth distribution</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Wealth is more unequally distributed in society than current income. </span><span class="font13">Nevertheless, less systematic historical knowledge is accessible on wealth&nbsp;than on income.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Inequalities of wealth distribution became considerably more moderate </span><span class="font13">in the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, albeit </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">equalization advanced&nbsp;at slower pace.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">The moderation of wealth concentration in the interwar period was slow, <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">gaining pace during World War II and in the 1950s and early 1970s,&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">then </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">stagnating from the 1980s.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Another sign of the fall in wealth differentials - <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a growing ratio of citizens accrued some kind of savings.</span></p>
<p class="font13">In West Germany in 1962, 60.1% of the population had a savings account, in 1983 - 90.3%.</p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The causes of the changes</span></p>
<p class="font11">•the causes of the decline of income inequalities in the first two-thirds of the twentieth century</p>
<p class="font11" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">•the reasons for the reversing trend at the end of the century</p>
<p class="font11" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">Why did income inequalities decline between 1900 and 1970?</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;"><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The extension of franchise - </span><span class="font11">and therefore the power of lower-income worker and employee groups strengthened.</span></p>
<p class="font11" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">In the interwar period, the lower-income social strata were given franchise basically in all European conn tries -&gt; the decline of liberal parties and the rise of Social Democratic and&nbsp;Christian Democratic mass parties, finding their major constituencies among employees&nbsp;and other lower-income groups.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 19pt 0pt;"><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The unionization of the labour force - </span><span class="font11">facilitated the wage dispute</span></p>
<p class="font11" style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;">The <span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">emergence of the welfare state </span><span class="font11">and its expansion after the World War II.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 22pt 0pt;"><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The socialist alternative</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">An increase in the ratio of employees, </span><span class="font13">accompanied by </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a decline </span><span class="font13">in the number and proportion of those </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">self-employed. </span><span class="font13">Traditionally, self-employed have had bigger differences in wages.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A declining importance of agriculture </span><span class="font13">(low wage sector). Plus industry generates lower profits (as compared with the 19<sup>th</sup> century) - its higher&nbsp;higher profitability becomes more moderate compared with agriculture&nbsp;and the service sector.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Demographic changes: </span><span class="font13">population growth in Europe slows down, reserves of labour force become smaller, social groups with low&nbsp;education gradually join general pattern of declining fertility&nbsp;-&gt;unqualified labour becomes a scarcer commodity, its price rises.</span></p>

<p class="font13">•Changing family structures - a growing share of singe-parent families; child-free couples with double income = both partners employed</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 123pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sectoral distribution of labourforce:</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">Agriculture, forestry and fishing.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">Different branches of industry (the processing industry, mining,&nbsp;energy production and&nbsp;construction)</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">Services (education, health, research, commerce,&nbsp;transportation,&nbsp;telecommunications, banking and&nbsp;insurance, mass media, public&nbsp;administration).</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 22pt;">Already in the 1930s-1940s, economists identified the following&nbsp;pattern in change of the relative size of&nbsp;people employed in these 3 sectors:</p><div style="float:right;layout-flow:horizontal;">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 3pt 0pt;"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">— Aorortur*</span></p></li></ul>

<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 22pt;">Agriculture - declining</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 22pt;">Industry - rising from the late 18<sup>th </sup>century and declining in the 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:22pt;padding:0pt 0pt 52pt 0pt;">Services - rising</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A model of transition from pre-industrial to industrial and then to a post-industrial society</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:24pt;padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;"><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The causes of changes, </span><span class="font14">as suggested by economists:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:24pt;"><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Elasticity of demand -</span></p>
<p class="font14" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 24pt;">The demand for agricultural goods is physically limited (people can consume only a limited amount of food - unless, of course, the&nbsp;population is expanding). The demand for the goods of the&nbsp;industrial sector and especially for services is essentially insatiable.</p>
<p class="font14" style="padding:0pt 0pt 9pt 24pt;">The <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">growth in labour productivity </span><span class="font14">in agriculture and industry is faster - extra labour supply flows to the services</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:3pt;padding:0pt 0pt 21pt 15pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">At the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> cc. the agrarian sector was the biggest employer everywhere in Europe, with the exception of Britain&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">(industry as employer dominant from the 1820s) and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Belgium </span><span class="font13">(from&nbsp;the 1880s).</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:3pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 15pt;">Even on the eve of WWII most parts of</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:3pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 15pt;">Europe - <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">with the exception of Britain and a belt of countries from&nbsp;Switzerland to Sweden - </span><span class="font13">was agrarian&nbsp;(regarding distribution of labour!):&nbsp;Albania, Bulgaria, Romania - ca. 80% of&nbsp;the labour force earned their living in&nbsp;agriculture</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:15pt;">Spain, Portugal - ca. 50%</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:15pt;">Ireland and Italy - 48%</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;">France and Czechoslovakia - 36%</p>
<p style="text-indent:7pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A rapid contraction of agriculture after WWII.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:7pt;">By the 1990s:</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:7pt;">Belgium and UK - 2% of the population worked in agriculture; Sweden and W Germany - 3%; Netherlands - 4%; France - 5%&nbsp;Italy, Austria, Finland - 8%</p>
<p class="font13">Spain - 10%; Portugal - 17%</p>
<p class="font13">Bulgaria and Hungary - 18%</p>
<p class="font13">Poland - 28%; Romania - 29%</p>
<p class="font13">Albania - 55%</p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Industry </span><span class="font13">as the dominant sector in terms of employment:</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Countries with a long period of industrial dominance</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 20pt;">Great Britain - industry dominant from the 1820s to 1959. Belgium - 1880- 1965</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:20pt;">Switzerland 1888- 1970</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:20pt;padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">West Germany 1907- 1975.</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:20pt;">Most countries of Europe had <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a much shorter period in the</span></p>
<p style="text-indent:20pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1950s-1960s</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:20pt;">France -1954- 59</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:20pt;">Italy 1960- 65</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 202pt 7pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak of industrial employment in WE - in the 1960s (40-</span><span class="font13">45% of all those employed). Classic heavy industries (mining, metallurgy, steel processing, engineering industry, energy&nbsp;production) plus some future industries -pharmaceutics,&nbsp;electronics and car production.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 7pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A unique European phenomenon: </span><span class="font13">outside Europe, it occurred only in Taiwan, around 1980. In the US, Japan, South Korea,&nbsp;Canada, Australia - a direct transition from agriculture to&nbsp;services.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Social classes and strata:</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">Occupational structure as the major element of social structure</p>
<p style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Self-employed — </span><span class="font13">their numbers declined in the 20<sup>th</sup> century due to the fall of agricultural employment, technological changes within the&nbsp;agricultural sector, the vanishing of charftsmen’s workshops and small&nbsp;shops (cased by industrial concentration and transformation of&nbsp;commerce)</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 14pt;">1900 — self-employed constituted ca. 20% of economically active population in WE.</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">1950 — less than 10%</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 14pt;">When the trend was reversed (in some countries in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century) — the result of the tense labour market</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">In the Soviet block — this stratum shrank radically in the 1950s-1960s. Only in Yugoslavia and Poland where agriculture was not collectivized the&nbsp;ratio of independent fanners remained relatively high. An expansion of this&nbsp;sector in the 1990s</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Decline of unpaid family labour - </span><span class="font13">women assisting in the family farm, shop or workshop.</span></p>
<p class="font13">In the 1920s-1930s — 10-20% of total workforce in WE, almost 1/3 in East-Central and Southern Europe</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">Reduced by 1/2 by the 1960s</p>
<p style="text-indent:22pt;padding:53pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Employees - </span><span class="font13">a widening group of the economically active</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:22pt;">Significant internal transformations:</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 22pt;">White-collar salaried employees (managers, office workers, engineers, commercial employees)— continuously expanding group, especially in&nbsp;1950-2000. - linked to the expansion of the service sector, structual&nbsp;transformation and technological development in industry</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The upper classes — </span><span class="font13">the most important changes concentrated on 4 periods:</span></p>
<p class="font13">The aftermath of WWI and the formation of new nation states (East</p>
<p class="font13">Central Europe)</p>
<p class="font13">The emergence of right-wing dictatorships in the interwar period (Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal)</p>
<p class="font13">The rise of the communist regimes after WWII</p>
<p class="font13">The collapse of the Soviet block in the late 1980s</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:15pt 0pt 27pt 9pt;">WWI — destroyed the Central European monarchies and discredited the political role of <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">aristocracy. </span><span class="font13">In Austria noble titles were&nbsp;abolished, in Germany castles, parks and other real estate&nbsp;expropriated in return for compensation.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 9pt;">Land reforms in East Central Europe and the Balkans in the 1920s-1930s — diminished the concentration of land (especially among ethnic minorities — Romania)</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 9pt;">After WWII — aristocracy almost completely vanished in Germany, in East Central Europe — where the titles of nobility were prohibited&nbsp;from use. In other countries, like the UK, aristocracy survived, yet its&nbsp;position dramatically weakened. The aristocracy was able to preserve&nbsp;its power longest in Spain and Portugal — based on the concentration&nbsp;of landed property</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:9pt;padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">1962 — in Spain % of all lands belonged to 1.8% agricultural estates</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The business elites (industrialists, bankers) — </span><span class="font13">also affected badly by two world wars, especially in ECE</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">From the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century the scale of public ownership widened in WE (especially France and UK)</p>
<p class="font13">The rise of professional management</p>
<p class="font13">Growth in the size of business enterprises — the split between ownership and management</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">Family firms transformed into joint stock companies whose owners were often companies themselves (banks, insurance companies, investment&nbsp;funds)</p>
<p class="font13">In Germany — already in the 19<sup>th</sup> century</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 12pt 0pt;">France and the UK — family firms vanished only after WWII</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The managerial class — </span><span class="font13">growth in numbers, their incomes showing greater dynamics than capital revenues. Often got joint ownership in the&nbsp;companies they directed&nbsp;'The managerial revolution' — the concept coined by some American&nbsp;sociologists in the early 1940s — managers replacing the old ruling class of&nbsp;capitalists&nbsp;a channel of mobility to the upper classes, decreasing the internal unity of&nbsp;the upper classes. However there were limits to this process: assimilation&nbsp;into the milieu, recruited from the upper classes</span></p>
<p class="font13">Substantial changes in the composition of the political elite: the rise of Social Democratic, Peasant and other newly established parties&nbsp;-won seats in the parliament and became members of the government&nbsp;already in the 1920s — UK, Austria, Germany, Scandinavia.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">The Franco era in Spain — army as an important channel of social mobility</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">From 1950s — the openness of the political elite declined in most of WE. Politics as a profession.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">The growth of 'functional elite' — leading positions in public administration, science and education, culture, the churches, the military,&nbsp;the judiciary. - This group considerably increased the diversity of the&nbsp;upper classes, the degree of their integration varied, strong subcultural&nbsp;differences, differed in the degree of their openness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of the elite in <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">East Central Europe </span><span class="font13">after WWII —&nbsp;not only the political elite but also the elimination of the economic&nbsp;elite with nationalization of big businesses and large agricultural&nbsp;estates</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">At the initial states in the formation of the new political elite, political considerations overruled all others. Later — a process of&nbsp;professionalization.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">After the collapse of the socialist regimes in the region, the replacement of the former political elite did not take place on the&nbsp;similar scale as after WWII. Yet <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">significant regional differences: </span><span class="font13">the&nbsp;Czech Republic, the former East Germany, Albania — political elites&nbsp;were replaced.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 16pt;"><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">The middle classes — </span><span class="font13">prblems with defining this social stratum -in-between position; non-manual occupations</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 16pt;">Identity taking shape in opposition to aristocracy and working class Middle class culture — rationality, emotional control, respect for&nbsp;knowledge and education, independence, family values</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 16pt;">The old middle class of the early 19<sup>th</sup> century — owners of small businesses (craftsmen and tradesmen), practitioners of independent&nbsp;occupations (liberal professions)</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:45pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">From the late 19<sup>th</sup> century — the growth of salaried employees — their income, lifestyle, identity as middle class, although they did not own&nbsp;means of production — this stratum was rapidly growing in the 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century— employees of the states but also employees of big businesses</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">Factors explaining their growth — the rise of welfare state, the growth of company size, the development of services</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">Their differentiation from manual workers and owners of small businesses but also from managers</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">Group identity even stronger among those employed by the state — often enjoyed special privileges with regard to remuneration, prospects for&nbsp;promotion and pension.</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;">Internal divisions within this group — hence the categories 'upper middle', Tow middle'...</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">The transformation of middle class culture in the 20<sup>th</sup> century — some components diffused in a society as a whole, others faded.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 23pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional differences: </span><span class="font13">in ECE and some Scandinavian countries — the middle class was traditionally small, the integration was less complete,&nbsp;the entreprenerial bourgeoisie remained weak, these positions were&nbsp;often filled with by industrialists or bankers of foreign/ethnic origin&nbsp;(German, Jewish, Armenian).</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">After WWII nationalization almost completely wiped out the old middle class. Only the white-collar (state) employees — their salaries close to&nbsp;those of blue-collar workers. A slow regeneration of small proprietors&nbsp;from the 1960s — the process most forward in Poland, Yugoslavia,&nbsp;Hungary — the distinct socialist version of petite bourgeoisie.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 34pt 0pt;"><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">The working class /blue-collar workers</span></p>
<p class="font13">In the 1850s-1950s at least — a considerable cohesion based on a relatively homogeneous social position</p>
<p class="font13">A strong group identity, effective collective action through trade-unions The composition, the group consciousness and the social position&nbsp;transformed considerably, especially from the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p class="font13">Its growth and then its decline in the 20<sup>th</sup> century:</p>
<p class="font13">UK, 1910 — 71% of all employees were blue-collar workers 1980 — 38%</p>
<p class="font13">France, 1910 — 49% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="font13">1980 -39%</p>
<p class="font13">Causes: structural shifts in economy (from industrial to post-industrial society), structural transformations within industries (advanced&nbsp;technology requires less manual labour)</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">Internal differentiation of the working class in post-WWII decades: migration from rural areas, international migration of labour,&nbsp;women entering occupations that had been traditionally reserved&nbsp;for men</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">Rise in qualifications, improved educational opportunities for children (expansion of higher education in the 1960s), rising living&nbsp;standards — incomes and consumer habits started approximating&nbsp;the middle classes. Improved social protection -the achievements&nbsp;of the welfare state — the breakthrough happened in the 1960s.&nbsp;Mixed marriages — workers' wives found it easier to find simple,&nbsp;non-manual work in the service sector.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">The waning intensity of class conflicts after WWII. Institutionalization of class conflicts — the influence of tradeunions and left-wing parties.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 27pt 0pt;">New social cleavages in WE and SE from the 1970s — questionable if they could still be called 'the working class' — the <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">'underclass'&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">Social marginalization, dependence of welfare benefits, often come&nbsp;from immigrants with low education and qualifications, language&nbsp;problems, disabled people, drug-addicts, long-term sick and&nbsp;unemployed people</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">East Central Europe:</span></p>
<p class="font13">In the interwar period, the proportion of the working class lower than in WE (except Czechoslovakia), agricultural workers significantly&nbsp;represented.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:16pt 0pt 25pt 23pt;">Large scale industrialization after WWII. By the 1970s-1980s, especially in East Germany and in Czechoslovakia, the proportion of&nbsp;workers in the economically active population reached a high level in&nbsp;an international context. The dominance of heavy industry and big&nbsp;companies — a certain homogenity to the working class. Yet, with&nbsp;exception of East Germany and Czechoslovakia, most workes had rural&nbsp;background.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 23pt;">The relative income position and social status of this group considerably improved. Job security significantly higher than in WE.&nbsp;Yet regarding consumption, workers in the region lagged behind WE.</p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;"><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Post-modernism </span><span class="font13">emphasises the importance of ideologies, culture, social movements. Originally an artistic movement. Wider use since the late&nbsp;1970s. Rejection of a systematic social theory.</span></p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">The lowest common denominator: the idea that inherited material and cultural assets (i.e. class) cease to define a position in society, social classes&nbsp;dissolve, world appeal's for the individual as the market of infinite choices,&nbsp;consumption define status and lifestyle.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">How do the developments of the last few decades conform to these predictions?</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:7pt;padding:85pt 0pt 26pt 0pt;">Restructuring of employment? - Yes. The service sector boomed. The number of manual workers dropped. The rise of the 4<sup>th</sup> sector — IT.</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:7pt;">Horizontal social stratification based on gender, age, ethnicity, family type with related types of conflict, disintegration of traditional classbased or occupational subcultures.</p>
<p class="font13" style="text-indent:7pt;padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;">Factors underlying pluralization of life-style — the increase of living standard and the length of leisure time.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">However...</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">The rise of services — a much longer trend. Yet the growing employment in services did not result in the radical change of the nature of occupations.&nbsp;Outsorcing — often creates the impression of growth, however earlier the&nbsp;same operations were done within the industrial sector. Deskilling of&nbsp;operations. Deterioration of working conditions due to technological&nbsp;development.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">The widening gap between the incomes of higher and lower white-collar employees. Traditionally well-paid positions requiring secondary education&nbsp;have been rapidly decreasing (technological progress plus exportation of&nbsp;industrial jobs overseas). Less secure jobs and non-standard forms of work&nbsp;contract (temporary, part-time, forced self-employment)</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 25pt 0pt;">Mass unemployment from the mid-1980s in WE. Long-term unemployment. Traditional classes continue to define life chances.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">New information technologies fascilitated the reshaping of the work process in a more hierarchical fashion</p>
<p class="font13">Restructuring of public services along the line of standards imported from private economy.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">A greater role of managerial control.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">The weakening of the social weight and political strength of the traditional working class, while the social groups replacing it clearly do not posess the&nbsp;same level of cohesion and organizational strength. The managerial class&nbsp;has not disintegrated.</p>
<p class="font13" style="padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;">Globalization — released capital from its dependence on national labour markets and nation states.</p>
