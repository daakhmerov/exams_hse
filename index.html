<p class="font19">Industrial revolution and urbanisation in Europe in the&nbsp;late 18<sup>th</sup> - 19<sup>th</sup> centuries</p>
<p class="font7">To summarise: <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the early industrialisation affected only&nbsp;certain regions and branches&nbsp;of economy, had relatively&nbsp;low rates of growth, took&nbsp;place against the&nbsp;background of&nbsp;protoindustrialization.</span></p>
<p class="font7">Yet <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by the 1830s </span><span class="font7">Europe had become divided in&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">industrialised areas in the&nbsp;core and backward agrarian&nbsp;periphery</span><span class="font7">-Scandinavia, the&nbsp;Iberian peninsula, Italy, the&nbsp;Balkans, eastern parts of the&nbsp;Habsburg empire, the Russian&nbsp;empire.</span></p>
<p class="font18">To what extent <span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">the development in the core slowed down industrialisation in the periphery </span><span class="font18">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">debatable. </span><span class="font18">The industrial development in the West&nbsp;did depend on </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">cheap raw materials and foodstuff&nbsp;produced in the backward East.</span></p>
<p class="font18">Certainly, within the Habsburg monarchy tensions between east and west were obvious: Hungary&nbsp;became the source of cheap foodstuff and raw&nbsp;materials. However market-oriented agriculture in&nbsp;Hungary got new markets in expanding urban&nbsp;centres in the Austrian part of the empire. The&nbsp;same observation is valid for Prussia and&nbsp;Pomerania.</p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Second stage of industrialisation - the 1840s-1870s - France, Germany, the US. Railways, machinery, metallurgy</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Railways </span><span class="font16">were especially important: </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">created national markets, linked production sites with raw materials. </span><span class="font16">The states supported&nbsp;their construction because of their </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">military significance -</span><span class="font16">enabled the states to relocate troops at amazing speed.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Railway construction <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">stimulated the development of iron- and steel-manufacturing, mechanical engineering and machine&nbsp;construction. </span><span class="font16">Railways became the major consumers in these&nbsp;branches of industry.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Their construction required unprecedented <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">capital investments </span><span class="font16">- led to the emergence of </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">investment banks, </span><span class="font16">which were the&nbsp;only institutions capable of providing </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">long-term credits </span><span class="font16">(at the&nbsp;earlier stage an entrepreneur could succeed with short-term&nbsp;credits, as he had to cover only the costs of raw materials and&nbsp;wages - something that could be done with working capital).</span></p>
<p class="font16">The first investment bank was founded in <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">France in 1852 </span><span class="font16">(authorised by Napoleon III personally) - </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Credit MobiIier,</span><span class="font16"> It&nbsp;provided the model for many provincial and Parisian&nbsp;investment banks </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">- Credit Lyonnais 1863, Societe Generale&nbsp;1864.</span><span class="font16"> These banks were generated money by </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">selling out&nbsp;railway companies’ stocks.</span></p>
<p class="font7">In <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany </span><span class="font7">first investment banks emerged </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">after 1848. </span><span class="font7">In contrast with</span></p>
<p class="font7">France, they <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">became shareholders of railway companies, </span><span class="font7">their representatives sat on their executive boards, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">from the 1860s, </span><span class="font7">when the&nbsp;need for capital investment in railway construction diminished, the German&nbsp;banks started </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">buying shares in other branches of industry, </span><span class="font7">thus promoting&nbsp;mergers and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">formation of cartels in coal mining and metallurgy&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">(agreement on the volume of production, on hiring labour, purchasing raw&nbsp;materials, the distribution of orders and marketing finished goods).</span></p>
<p class="font7">Most recent research, however, suggests that banks perhaps played lesser role in developing relatively backward regions. Even in Germany banks&nbsp;feared risks present in new branches of industry.</p>
<p class="font7">At this stage more sophisticated technologies were used - they required <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">specialised technical education. </span><span class="font7">In France engineers were trained in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ecole des&nbsp;Mines, Ecole Politechnique,</span><span class="font7"> in Germany-in Polytechnics and technical schools.&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany </span><span class="font7">was especially known for its </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">industrial laboratories </span><span class="font7">that ensured the&nbsp;leading position of Germany in electrical and chemical industries, as well as car-manufacturing in the late 19th- early 20th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">1873-1896 - the period of economic depression </span><span class="font16">caused by the </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">transportation revolution </span><span class="font16">(railways and steamboats), as well as by&nbsp;</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the influx of agricultural products </span><span class="font16">from the American Midwest,&nbsp;Canada, Russia, Hungary and Latin America. In the same period&nbsp;</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany and the US became serious competitors </span><span class="font16">for British&nbsp;/industries, as Britain was lagging behind in technical education</span></p>
<p class="font16">and suffered from poor cooperation between financial and industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="font15">The <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">third stage of industrialisation - from the late 1890s till 1914. </span><span class="font15">Industrialisation reached </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy, Sweden, the Austrian&nbsp;part of Austro-Hungary, Russia, </span><span class="font15">Spain and Hungary (to some&nbsp;extent).</span></p>
<p class="font15">New technologies - <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">chemical, electric industries, car-manufacturing. </span><span class="font15">Britain loosing its leading position to France, the US and Germany. </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany is particularly strong in newer&nbsp;industries.</span></p>
<p class="font15">By the early 20th century Germany had been producing 80% of all synthetic dyers, was the world biggest producer of&nbsp;chemicals; and by 1913 it controlled more than 1/2 of global&nbsp;trade in electric goods.</p>
<p class="font15">The countries that were latecomers to the process of industrialisation had a chance to develop these newer, hi-tech industries: Italy was developing car-manufacturing and&nbsp;chemicals, Japan focused of explosives and electrical&nbsp;equipment.</p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Gerschenkron </span><span class="font15">(focusing on Russia) insisted that the countries that reached the take-off at this third stage of industrialisation had to&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">pass it very quickly, </span><span class="font15">otherwise they would have failed in&nbsp;competition with the world leaders - showed very high rates of&nbsp;growth (it could also be explained by the fact that they started&nbsp;from a very low level, which automatically gives massive increase&nbsp;in percentages).</span></p>
<p class="font15">Industrialisation is <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">stimulated by the state, </span><span class="font15">which needs </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">to overcome backwardness in military technologies - </span><span class="font15">therefore it&nbsp;focuses on </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">railway construction and heavy industries. </span><span class="font15">The </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">transfer&nbsp;of technologies and foreign investments </span><span class="font15">created an opportunity for&nbsp;a very rapid transition.</span></p>
<p class="font15">Indeed, Sweden and Russia had very high rates of growth (in Russia -8% increase in the volume of industrial goods in the 1890s; in Sweden -12% between it 888 and 1896).</p>
<p class="font15">By 1900 Russia had become the 4th world producer of iron, and took the Sth place in the production of steel. The length of railway lines in&nbsp;Russia increased by 87% between 1892 and 1903, the production of&nbsp;oil increased 3-fold between 1887 and 1898. In the early 20th century&nbsp;Russia became the biggest producer of oil in the world.</p>
<p class="font15">However, even in Russia textile manufacturing had been developing even before the 1860s, <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">railway construction boomed in the 1870s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy does not fit this model at all - </span><span class="font15">its agrarian backward south certainly placed the country to European periphery, however in&nbsp;1896-1914 it did not experience rapid industrial growth.</span></p>
<p class="font7">Recent scholarship suggests that the <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">contrast between Britain and backward countries on the European periphery in terms of the state participation in industrial&nbsp;revolution had been certainly exaggerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The role of the state in the building of the British overseas empire </span><span class="font7">should not be forgotten. We also need to take into account the structure of power and authority&nbsp;in each particular case. In Britain it was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">strong unified legislature </span><span class="font7">with no regional&nbsp;parliaments and corporate privileges. State participation in industrialisation also&nbsp;could take the form of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">destroying feudal relationships in agriculture, guild control&nbsp;and limitations, </span><span class="font7">as well as the state supporting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">infrastructure, </span><span class="font7">creating </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">legal&nbsp;instruments, </span><span class="font7">such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">limited responsibility and shares, </span><span class="font7">development of technical&nbsp;education and mass primary education as the means of disciplining labour&nbsp;resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Class as a new category of analysis. Wealth instead of privileges.</span></p>
<p class="font4">The notion of 'class' was already used in the second half of the 18th century (Adam Smith) to&nbsp;describe distinctions within the estates. It was&nbsp;already visible, that the nature of wealth was&nbsp;changing, that men were defined by their&nbsp;incomes.</p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The french Revolution politicised the term ‘class’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Abbe Sieyes ‘Qu'-est-ce-que le tiers etat?’: </span><span class="font4">the third estate as the true nation, however in&nbsp;terms of real politics, he is addressing himself to&nbsp;bourgeoisie - wealthy, educated people.</span></p>
<p class="font4">The French Revolution is instrumental for forging the notion of <span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">‘bourgeoisie' - </span><span class="font4">with its particular&nbsp;social identity and shared political ideas. By&nbsp;the early 1</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9th</span><span class="font4"> century the idea that society is&nbsp;fundamentally divided, and different classes&nbsp;are driven by antagonistic interests, becomes&nbsp;common place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Bourgeoisie, Middle Class(es) - </span><span class="font13">as those people</span></p>
<p class="font13">who stand between the nobility, on the one hand, and the working classes and peasantry, on the other. Relatively affluent, ‘clean’&nbsp;occupation for men and relatively free from labour sheltered existence&nbsp;for women, children and old people.</p>
<p class="font13">The idea that bourgeoisie is becoming the dominant class is supported by evidence:</p>
<p class="font13">1830-31 two bankers, Lafitte and Perier became Prime Ministers in France,</p>
<p class="font13">Marx suggests that with the 1830 revolution financial aristocracy replaces</p>
<p class="font13">he nobility as the dominant class.</p>
<p class="font13">For liberals (Guizot): class distinctions are justified because they are produced by fair, rational competition.</p>
<p class="font13">The conservatives and socialists (the term appears with the revolution of 1830) are very critical. Yet before Marx the early socialists (Robert Owen,&nbsp;Pierre Joseph Proudhon) hope for a peaceful transition to a classless&nbsp;society.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Karl Marx (Communist Manifesto 1847; Capital 1867): </span><span class="font13">capitalist exploitation and class consciousness as inevitable&nbsp;outcomes of economic development while the proletarian&nbsp;revolution would abolish class distinctions and exploitation.</span></p>
<p class="font13">In his lifetime, politics seemed to confirm his forecast: several waves of revolutions across Europe: 1830, 1848. 1871&nbsp;in Paris.</p>
<p class="font13">Yet the tensions are loosened by legalization of trade-unions, by state-sponsored educational systems, compulsory military service, by various welfare schemes.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">To what extent the 19<sup>th</sup> century was the bourgeois century?</span></p>
<p class="font13">Aristocracy retained its dominant position in politics, the military</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The middle classes - fragmented.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Liberal professions - as a distinctive interest group. The bearers of liberal ideology, before 1848 they shared anti-governmental sentiments.</p>
<p class="font13">The civil servants - much more numerous group, esp. in the second half of the 19th century</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">To what extent the middle classes share the same (liberal) values?</span></p>
<p class="font13">Belief in human progress, national unity, education, constitutional government, family, individual freedom. Yet both constitutional government&nbsp;and individual freedom could mean very different things in the 19th century.&nbsp;Some of these ideas are shared by other groups. Middle classes supported&nbsp;different political parties and economic doctrines.</p>
<p class="font13">Perhaps, education, family, the position of women in a society, culture - as the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Culture and leisure </span><span class="font13">- increasingly defined by middle classes. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">State and&nbsp;municipal patronage replace&nbsp;aristocratic patronage. </span><span class="font13">The first public&nbsp;art gallery - Vienna 1781, the Louvre&nbsp;in Paris is open to public in 1793, the&nbsp;National Gallery in London 1823.</span></p>
<p class="font13">The middle classes become the <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">major consumers of the new art. </span><span class="font13">The lower&nbsp;classes are excluded by various&nbsp;means (letters of introduction,&nbsp;admission fees). Entrepreneurs start&nbsp;collecting art. Lit&amp;Phil societies&nbsp;(Manchester 1781, Leeds 1819).&nbsp;Exhibitions and concerts, libraries and&nbsp;reading rooms.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Critique against popular culture, especially against music-halls.</p>
<p class="font13">Yet before the advent of railways, the middle classes mostly imitate&nbsp;aristocracy in terms of leisure pursuits&nbsp;(sea-side resorts and spas).</p>
<p class="font13">With the spread of railway network Brighton becomes accessible for&nbsp;people from London (2hrs by train): in&nbsp;1862 on Easter holidays 132 000&nbsp;eople go to Brighton - soon Queen&nbsp;'Victoria moves from Brighton to the&nbsp;Isle of White. The British aristocracy&nbsp;migrates to Normandy and the&nbsp;Mediterranean. Cheap railway&nbsp;tickets - 1870s, when 3rd class train&nbsp;carriages appear. Thomas Cook’s&nbsp;tours - to the 1851 Exhibition in&nbsp;London.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Grands magasins: </span><span class="font13">first appear in Paris in the 1860s (Bon Marche 1869: described by Emile Zola in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Le Bonheur des Dames</span><span class="font13"> 1883). For the first&nbsp;time, one can buy clothes, footwear, underwear, furniture, jewellery,&nbsp;cosmetics and food in one place.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Target middle class women - a safe, respectable, clean and elegant space where a decent woman can go on her own. New&nbsp;technologies immediately used in these spaces - glass display&nbsp;indows, gas and electric light. Enforce rigid moral standards on their&nbsp;personnel - poorly paid yet provided with free meals, housing (in&nbsp;1878 90 members of staff lived in Bon Marche): their leisure is highly&nbsp;supervised, as the staff should share the same taste with bourgeois&nbsp;consumers</p>
<p class="font13">In the late 18th century - organised in guilds, which regulate their economic activities, discourage competition, set prices. The guild is more than&nbsp;economic institution - it is <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a corporation that defines the whole life </span><span class="font13">of its&nbsp;member, its social status. Nowadays, historians start criticising the idea that&nbsp;guilds prevented economic growth.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Marseille 1782:</p>
<p class="font13">4% of master craftsmen employ almost 20% of all journeymen - workshops with 9 or more people employed</p>
<p class="font13">80% of master craftsmen work in workshops with 3 and less people employed</p><div>
<p class="font13">Up to the 19th century many industries grew by multiplication of small artisanal workshops specialised in a particular branch, which were&nbsp;connected by a network of subcontracts. A master craftsmen retained the&nbsp;/core of permanently employed qualified labourers, and in better times&nbsp;/ temporarily employed more hands with poor or no skills.</p></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font13">Precarious economic position, yet these people were very proud of being independent. <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Group identity built around their corporate membership. </span><span class="font13">The&nbsp;importance of places where the corporation held their reunions - a church, a&nbsp;tavern. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Shared values - collectivism, paternalism, hierarchy, discipline. </span><span class="font13">By the&nbsp;late 19th century, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">with the spread of mass consumer culture, traditional&nbsp;artisanal culture vanishes.</span></p>
<p class="font13">In legal terms, the guilds were abolished in Spain in 1812, in Sweden in 1847, in Austria in 1859, in Germany in 1869-1871, in France in 1871.</p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">/</span></p>
<p class="font13">The other factors, working in the same direction - <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">population growth and /transportation revolution: </span><span class="font13">most arts and crafts do not have enough work to&nbsp;/ employ people, local consumer markets get integrated.</span></p>
<p class="font13">In Prussia between 1800 and 1843 traditional crafts employed about 15% of the population, yet the population increases by 50% - the actual number of&nbsp;people employed increases dramatically. In France, by 1830-1840,&nbsp;population increase and unemployment push people to the cities where&nbsp;they try to live by crafts - the guilds are overpopulated.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Statistics </span><span class="font13">remains very problematic. ‘Workers' in the 19th century censuses were often employed in crafts and not&nbsp;as factory labour.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Quantitatively, the number of small independent producers is increasing during the industrial revolution.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Factory and small scale home-based artisanal production co-exist for a very long time, </span><span class="font13">even in textiles.</span></p>
<p class="font13">In France, in 1906, half of the labour force was employed by enterprises with 5 or less people. In Germany, in 1901,&nbsp;31% of industrial labour was employed by enterprises with 5&nbsp;or less people.</p>
<p class="font13">Still, small-scale enterprises gradually lost their independence - work on subcontracts for larger ones.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Access to credit, raw materials, labour resources, markets</span></p>
<p class="font13">- increasingly depends on big business. Artisans get integrated into the networks of production and&nbsp;consumption controlled by big capitalists.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Early labour movement built upon this crisis: </span><span class="font13">people who&nbsp;nevertheless persist working in&nbsp;this way or who live by retailing&nbsp;goods manufactured at&nbsp;factories.</span></p>
<p class="font13">The first half of the 19th century - as the period of mass protests: <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">1819 Peterloo massacre, Captain&nbsp;Swing riots in 1830-31, the Chartist&nbsp;movement, weavers of Lyon in&nbsp;1831 and 1834, the revolution of&nbsp;1830, the revolution of 1848. </span><span class="font13">In all&nbsp;these cases, people defend&nbsp;traditional moral economy, they&nbsp;are against new technologies,&nbsp;high taxes and tariffs, demand&nbsp;‘just’ grain prices.</span></p><div><img src="Презентация_files/1f403537353d423046384f-1.jpg" style="width:146pt;height:475pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font13">In France, in 1830 artisans start publishing several newspapers targeting this social group in particular - L’Artisan, Le Journal des ouvriers, Le&nbsp;Peuple, Г Atelier. Speak against the loss of skills caused by&nbsp;industrialization, call for protection of small-scale enterprises from&nbsp;competition. In Germany in 1848 many deputies from this social stratum&nbsp;in the Frankfurt Parliament often call for protecting their corporate rights&nbsp;as/ourgers.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The governments brutally suppress mass protests: create class solidarity, in a sense they are much more efficient than socialist propaganda or&nbsp;economic conditions of production. </span><span class="font13">By the 1860s artisans either become&nbsp;integrated into the labour movement, or share petty bourgeois values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Petty bourgeoisie, low middle class(es) - </span><span class="font13">small-scale entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, lower ranks of civil service,&nbsp;school teachers... No common identity, class&nbsp;consciousness. However, small-scale entrepreneurs and&nbsp;shopkeepers do share some common values -</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">respectability </span><span class="font13">as a mark of their (threatened) social status.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Yet they are vulnerable - depend on credit, raw materials, access to markets. More often they downshift and&nbsp;become a part of the working class. Their precarious&nbsp;existence define their political sympathies.</p>
<p class="font13">By the late 19th century in France and Germany tend to support right-wing parties. Their dream is that their children&nbsp;become <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">white-collar employees </span><span class="font13">(and this sector is rapidly&nbsp;growing in the second half of the 19th century).</span></p>
<p class="font13">Other factors that destroy traditional artisanal culture -<span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">repeated attempts by the middle class(es) to regulate and reform popular, plebeian culture: </span><span class="font13">instill work discipline and&nbsp;temperance.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Traditional (artisanal) popular culture is transformed into <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">mass culture </span><span class="font13">by its increasing </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">commodification built around leisure:&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">music-halls, mass sport, circuses, mass circulation press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Lower middle classes that aspire to become integrated into bourgeoisie seek different forms of entertainment: </span><span class="font13">clubs, self-help associations, lectures, concerts, reading rooms.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Literacy and mass schooling produce a stream of publications -manuals on different branches of industrial productions: what was formerly a shared guild secret could be studied&nbsp;independently.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Working class(es)</span></p>
<p class="font13">Mechanisation and concentration of production process at factories change experience of labour force: separation of home&nbsp;and work, factory discipline, formalised rules of conduct, social&nbsp;distance between a worker and an entrepreneur is considerably&nbsp;greater than in a small artisanal workshop.</p>
<p class="font13">In those branches of industry where mechanisation&nbsp;considerably advanced&nbsp;(textiles), entrepreneurs face&nbsp;the problem of recruiting&nbsp;labour force: rely on women&nbsp;and children - as those&nbsp;categories who value their&nbsp;independence less.</p><div><img src="Презентация_files/1f403537353d423046384f-2.jpg" style="width:395pt;height:238pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font13">At the early stages of industrial revolution, industrial labour is very volatile - people seek other employment. Even in later generations,&nbsp;industrial workers often see their condition as a temporary stage in&nbsp;their life.</p>
<p class="font13">The early industrial production still depends on season (once machines are powered by water, factories had to stop when water&nbsp;level in streams is too high or too low - lay people out). The steam&nbsp;engine and a growing production speed increase pressure on&nbsp;labour force.</p>
<p class="font13">The idea that industrialisation produces less skilled labour force - a contested idea. The very concept of ‘skills’, ‘qualification' is not neutral - it&nbsp;defines wages. In the 19th century qualification is increasingly associated&nbsp;with work performed by men. Female occupations are for ‘unskilled’&nbsp;labour - precisely because women's wages are essential for economic&nbsp;survival of a family but they are complementary. Women take up jobs that&nbsp;men would never accept. Migrants, ethnic minorities are also associated&nbsp;with unskilled labour.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Working class women and their occupations:</span></p>
<p class="font13"> Economic growth is achieved not only by mechanisation of production process but also standardisation of goods and division of labour: waged&nbsp;labour working at home or in small workshops - e.g. dress-making. Depend&nbsp;on the suppliers of raw materials and people who sell finished goods.&nbsp;Women employed in this industry learn their skills at home - sewing is not&nbsp;recognised as ‘skill’, seen as natural for women. Work at home, setting up&nbsp;a small workshop does not require big capital investments, depend on&nbsp;markets, very insecure in terms of employment.</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Domestic servants - </span><span class="font13">their numbers are increasing with the expansion of middle&nbsp;class(es). In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, servants&nbsp;become an urban social group. A middle&nbsp;class woman is not expected to do&nbsp;manual work. The largest sector of female&nbsp;employment. Working time is not&nbsp;regulated. Informal, personal relations&nbsp;between an employer and (her) servants,&nbsp;isolation from other people in the same&nbsp;position - a very vulnerable position. A&nbsp;growing spatial distance between&nbsp;servants and their masters - a separate&nbsp;entrance for servants to the house or&nbsp;apartment.</span></p><div><img src="Презентация_files/1f403537353d423046384f-3.jpg" style="width:209pt;height:305pt;"/></div><br clear="all">
<p class="font20">Social structures in 19<sup>th</sup> century Europe: the countryside</p><img src="Презентация_files/1f403537353d423046384f-4.jpg" style="width:800pt;height:255pt;"/>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Even in 1900 vast majority of Europeans lived in the countryside.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Population of Europe <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">ca. 1900 - </span><span class="font16">over 400 million, with at least 84 million </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">(50% of economically active population)&nbsp;</span><span class="font16">were </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing.</span></p>
<p class="font16">Significant geographic variations:</p>
<p class="font16">in <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Bulgaria, Rumania, Russia more than <sup>3</sup>A </span><span class="font16">of economically active population on the eve of WWI&nbsp;were peasants,</span></p>
<p class="font16">in <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Austr</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">o-Hunggry</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">, Portugal, Spain - over 60%, </span><span class="font16">while in the Netherlands and Belgium - less than 1/3,&nbsp;in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">GB - less than 10%.</span></p>
<p class="font16">(Still, <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1870 the figures were 45% for England and Wales </span><span class="font16">and about 70% for France, Germany, Austria and&nbsp;Sweden).</span></p>
<p class="font15">From the Enlightenment, the <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">educated elites had ambivalent&nbsp;attitude towards peasants:&nbsp;</span><span class="font15">admired nature as rational, useful,&nbsp;productive and picturesque&nbsp;world, yet feared conservatism,&nbsp;brutality and ignorance of&nbsp;peasants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">r</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Jean-Francois Millet </span><span class="font15">and his paintings exhibited in the Salon in&nbsp;1857 and 1863: critics accused the&nbsp;painter for his </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">allegedly socialist&nbsp;sympathies</span></p>
<p class="font16">Three major processes that affected rural population in the 19th<sup> </sup>century:</p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">•Liberation from personal bondage</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">•The struggle for political domination in the village </span><span class="font16">after the dissolution of personal, feudal ties between peasants and&nbsp;landlords</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">•The spread of new forms of dominant culture, and the appropriation of traditional peasant culture by national&nbsp;movements</span></p>
<p class="font8">Emancipation of peasantry:</p>
<p class="font9">•personal freedom,</p>
<p class="font9">•equality before law,</p>
<p class="font9">•freedom of movement and occupation, abolition of orders.</p>
<p class="font8">Across Europe, the process takes about a century <span class="font9">to be completed: from </span><span class="font8">Savoy in 1771 </span><span class="font9">till&nbsp;the emancipation of </span><span class="font8">Roma people in the&nbsp;Danubian principalities in 1864. </span><span class="font9">All together, 33&nbsp;legislative acts in Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font9">The emancipation <span class="font8">could take many years: </span><span class="font9">21 years in Savoy, 43 years in Prussia, 73 years in&nbsp;Denmark. In Russia the process started in 1762&nbsp;(Peter III's manifesto on the liberty of the noble&nbsp;estate) till 1917 (the abolition of estates).</span></p>
<p class="font10">Even half a century after the abolition of serfdom in Denmark, landlords insisted upon&nbsp;their right to flog peasants on their estates.&nbsp;Russian courts sentenced peasants to corporal&nbsp;punishment even in the 20th century.</p>
<p class="font10">In many countries, landlords retained their seigniorial riqhts of hunting, fishinq, forest riqhts.</p>
<p class="font15">After the emancipation of peasantry, <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">old landowning aristocracy begins to decline.</span></p>
<p class="font15">Some scholars (like <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Arno Mayer and Dominic Lieven) </span><span class="font15">insist that ancient regime existed until WWI: </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;aristocracy and the church still dominated European&nbsp;politics in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</span></p>
<p class="font15">Yet at the very same time other scholars <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">(Geoff Ely and David Blackburn) </span><span class="font15">demonstrated that </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">the power&nbsp;of Prussian Junkers under Keiser Wilhelm had been&nbsp;exaggerated.</span></p>
<p class="font15">In any case, these studies warn us against oversimplified schemes (a transition from feudal class&nbsp;to bourgeoisie as the dominant class). <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Landed&nbsp;aristocracy retained considerable power in the 19<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>century thanks to its ties to big capital and&nbsp;commercialisation of their estates. </span><span class="font15">Sharecropping&nbsp;helped old aristocracy and the new social stratum of&nbsp;rural notables retain their influence in Spain, France&nbsp;or Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The driving force behind emancipation of peasantry:</span></p>
<p class="font15">•The spread of capitalist relations ?</p>
<p class="font15">•peasant uprisings ?</p>
<p class="font15">By themselves, do not necessarily lead to emancipation.</p>
<p class="font15">•Secular ideologies - the concept of human rights, <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">the idea of a nation-state </span><span class="font15">with all its mobilising potential - were important.</span></p>
<p class="font15">•However the primary impetus was the struggle between the state and the nobility. <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">France was the only country in Europe </span><span class="font15">where the abolition of&nbsp;feudal servitudes and personal dependency was initiated and carried out&nbsp;by the state that was not at the same time an </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">absolute monarchy.</span></p>
<p class="font16">In <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy and Germany </span><span class="font16">emancipation of peasantry happened mostly </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">in the period of the Napoleonic&nbsp;wars and in 1848. </span><span class="font16">The revolutions were not always&nbsp;beneficial to the process, sometimes they delayed&nbsp;emancipation, as they caused fears that the whole&nbsp;social order could be undermined. Napoleon's&nbsp;empire could also be seen as a synthesis of&nbsp;revolutionary initiatives from 1789-93 and the 181h&nbsp;century absolutist monarchy.</span></p>
<p class="font16">In <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Galicia and Croatia </span><span class="font16">peasants were liberated </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">by the emperor, in order to create a counterbalance to&nbsp;landed aristocracy in these regions - </span><span class="font16">the Poles and&nbsp;Hungarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Military defeats of Prussia in 1806 and Russia in 1856, </span><span class="font16">caused by technological and administrative&nbsp;backwardness, were also important triggers for&nbsp;emancipation process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The emancipation of peasantry </span><span class="font7">and modernisation of the state apparatus in the 19th century creates </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">two political problems for noble landowners:</span></p>
<p class="font7">•How to respond to the new constellation of <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">power in the countryside?</span></p>
<p class="font7">•How to behave towards the <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">centralised modern state and its administration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars </span><span class="font7">in Europe, the old aristocratic elites </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hope to restore their estate privileges and provincial autonomy, while&nbsp;Restoration monarchies prefer to rely on centralised administrative apparatus&nbsp;and police - </span><span class="font7">the legacy of Napoleon’s empire. The conflict is typical for France,&nbsp;Spain, Italy, Habsburg monarchy, Southern Germany.</span></p>
<p class="font7">With the course of time, the methods of control change. In Russia in the 1880s the position of a land captain <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(земский начальник]</span><span class="font7"> is introduced to mediate&nbsp;between the state and the village: he represents landed nobility. In France,&nbsp;Spain, Italy a similar role is played by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a prefect </span><span class="font7">who links governmental&nbsp;administration and local notables. Even in Britain the aristocracy and gentry&nbsp;monopolised local administration. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The old and the new elites learn to cooperate&nbsp;with the state </span><span class="font7">in order to impose new forms of social control over the&nbsp;countryside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Social protest in the countryside </span><span class="font15">threatens landowning elites&nbsp;everywhere in Europe in </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">1848, </span><span class="font15">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy in the 1860s and 1890s, </span><span class="font15">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Ireland, Scotland, Wales in the&nbsp;1870s-1880s.</span></p>
<p class="font15">However only in <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Russia in 1905-06 </span><span class="font15">the nobility and the state almost&nbsp;lost control over the events. Old&nbsp;ties between the landed nobility&nbsp;and peasantry were rapidly&nbsp;destroyed by the forces of&nbsp;modernisation, while nothing&nbsp;apparently came to replace&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The state, new forms of mass politics and new cultural forms (national culture) were penetrating village life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eugen Weber, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peasants into Frenchmen</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1976): </span><span class="font7">up to the 1880s, French peasants lived in a world of local, personal ties, had no national identity. It was only in the&nbsp;last two decades of the 19th century when they began to overcome their&nbsp;geographic isolation, archaic cultural practices, agricultural technologies&nbsp;oriented towards subsistence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">James Scott, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed</span><span class="font7"> (1998): describes the same processes in the categories of&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">legibility' and ‘transparency' of the peasantry from the state perspective. </span><span class="font7">Modern&nbsp;states are seeking to make population legible by standardising village life:&nbsp;introducing uniform weights and measures, single currency, abolishing internal&nbsp;customs and tax privileges, land cadastres, consolidating landholdings, assisting&nbsp;enclosures of commons.</span></p>
<p class="font7">Still, by tracing this process, we learn more about ‘ governmentality and the state than about peasants. In other words, unlike Weber, Scott claims that what is at&nbsp;stake is not peasants who become Frenchmen, but the French state that develops&nbsp;new technologies of governing population that enable the state to&nbsp;‘read'/document peasant life.</p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A class with no class consciousness?</span></p>
<p class="font15">A famous statement by <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Karl Marx in </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The eighteenth brumaire of Louis Bonaparte’</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1852):</span></p>
<p class="font15">&quot;The <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">small-holding peasants </span><span class="font15">form an enormous mass whose members live in similar conditions but without entering into manifold relations with&nbsp;each other. </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Their mode of production isolates them from one another&nbsp;</span><span class="font15">instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse. The isolation is furthered&nbsp;by France's </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">poor means of communication and the poverty </span><span class="font15">of the&nbsp;peasants. Their field of production, the small holding, permits no division&nbsp;of labor in its cultivation, no application of science, and therefore no&nbsp;multifariousness of development, no diversity of talent, no wealth of&nbsp;social relationships. Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient, directly produces most of its consumer needs, and thus&nbsp;acquires its means of life more through an exchange with nature than in&nbsp;intercourse with society. A small holding, the peasant and his family;&nbsp;beside it another small holding, another peasant and another family. A&nbsp;few score of these constitute a village, and a few score villages&nbsp;constitute a department. Thus </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">the great mass of the French nation is&nbsp;formed by the simple addition of homonymous magnitudes, </span><span class="font15">much as&nbsp;</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">potatoes in a sack form a sack of potatoes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Marx claims that peasantry is inherently unable to form political parties, </span><span class="font7">it needs to be represented, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">craves for populist regimes.</span></p>
<p class="font7">This idea was further developed <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by Eric Hobsbawm- peasants, as votes, are mobilised by other political parties, </span><span class="font7">even if the fate of any political&nbsp;movement in the 19th, and even in the 20th century, depends on their&nbsp;support. Recently, this idea has been challenged by historians who&nbsp;emphasise active peasant participation in the 19* century politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Yet by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century peasant parties can be found only in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe: </span><span class="font7">Bulgaria (1899-1901), the Czech lands&nbsp;(1899), Russia (SR-1901), Serbia (1903-1919), Croatia (1904), Hungary&nbsp;(1906-1909), Poland (1895).</span></p>
<p class="font7">All these parties <span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">defend traditional peasant way of life </span><span class="font7">(and peasant commune) against the world of industrial capitalism. In Bohemia, Galicia,&nbsp;Poland, Bulgaria these parties struggle for extending the franchise. All&nbsp;these parties </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">insist upon a land reform - </span><span class="font7">from socialisation to creating&nbsp;small private landholdings - and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">promote agricultural cooperation. </span><span class="font7">In&nbsp;Bulgaria and Croatia peasant parties consist mostly of peasants, while in&nbsp;Bohemia, Rumania and Poland attract other social groups, however their&nbsp;core is formed by educated peasants.</span></p>
<p class="font15">Demographic processes in&nbsp;the 19th&nbsp;century</p>
<p class="font13">Europe in the early modern period: <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">high fertility and high mortality rates </span><span class="font13">-&gt; the population was growing at a very&nbsp;slow pace </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">(3% per year population increase in the early&nbsp;18th century; </span><span class="font13">varied from 0.3% in the Netherlands to 8.9%&nbsp;in Russia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The demographic regime described by Thomas&nbsp;Malthus, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the&nbsp;principle of population,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">1798:</span></p>
<p class="font4">Under favourable conditions birth rates&nbsp;increase, death rates&nbsp;decrease, at some point&nbsp;they reach a level when&nbsp;land is no more able to&nbsp;feed the population -&gt;&nbsp;famine, plagues, wars -&gt; a&nbsp;rapid decrease in&nbsp;population -&gt; a new&nbsp;cycle begins...</p>
<p class="font4">His treatise published at the time when Europe started its transition to a new demographic regime!</p>
<p class="font4">From the mid-18th century till the 1870s (approx.) Europe experienced stable population increase:</p>
<p class="font4">Rates of demographic growth in Europe: 16th century - 32% increase</p>
<p class="font4">18th century - 13%</p>
<p class="font4">19th-56%</p>
<p class="font4">Even with substantial emigration from Europe and no immigration!</p>
<p class="font4">The share of Europe in world population:</p>
<p class="font4">1750-about 20%</p>
<p class="font4">1900- about 25%</p>
<p class="font4">[Compare: 2012 - 733 million without Russia, Ukraine and Belarus; 12% of the world population]</p>
<p class="font4">Unprecedented rates of demographic growth were achieved (for the first time!!!) with <span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">no corresponding decline in living standards&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">(as it had been in the early 14th century, in the late 16th century)&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">= Europe was able to break away from the Malthusian trap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">How? - </span><span class="font4">Thanks to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">agricultural revolution </span><span class="font4">and later the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">transportation revolution and the influx of grain from overseas</span></p><img src="Презентация_files/1f403537353d423046384f-5.jpg" style="width:304pt;height:205pt;"/>
<p class="font13">The concept of the <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">demographic transition’:</span></p>
<p class="font13">from a traditional society <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">(high mortality, high fertility) </span><span class="font13">to a modern society </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">(low mortality, low fertility) - </span><span class="font13">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">concept was suggested already in the inter-war period&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">in order to describe principal demographic processes&nbsp;that took place in Europe </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">from the mid-18th century to&nbsp;the early decades of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p class="font13">Assumed that the demographic transition <span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">started with declining mortality </span><span class="font13">(and thus population was rapidly&nbsp;growing), and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">later (after 1870) fertility also began&nbsp;declining -&gt; </span><span class="font13">low population growth rates in the 20th&nbsp;century.</span></p>
<p class="font4">A more detailed research on demographic processes in 19th century Europe showed that <span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the concept of the demographic&nbsp;transition </span><span class="font4">is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a gross oversimplification:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font4">• &nbsp;Not applicable to many regions of Europe</p></li><li>
<p class="font4">• &nbsp;Reflects certain trends we observe empirically, yet it does&nbsp;not explain them</p></li></ul>
<p class="font4">At least 3 different regional models of demographic processes in Europe in the 19th century</p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Sweden </span><span class="font16">(and оther Scandinavian countries) - </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">confirm the ‘demographic transition' model</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Mortality rates began go down:</span></p>
<p class="font16">Mid-18th century-30 deaths per 1000 people per year</p>
<p class="font16">Mid-19th century-20 deaths per 1000 people per year</p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">While birth rates remained fairly stable till 1870:</span></p>
<p class="font16">30+ births per 1000 people per year</p>
<p class="font16">Respectively, <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the population of Sweden was growing very fast:</span></p>
<p class="font16">5.6 people per 1000 per year increase in 1750-1800</p>
<p class="font16">7.8-7.9 people per 1000 per year increase in the 19th century</p>
<p class="font16">In mid-18th century the population of Sweden - below 2 million. In the late 19th century - about 5 million</p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Eastern Europe, </span><span class="font15">however, is very different</span></p>
<p class="font15">Population of the Russian empire is <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">growing at a fast pace </span><span class="font15">(8.6 people per 1000 per year in 1800-1850; 12.1 - in 1850-1900) - only&nbsp;England, Norway and Finland are growing faster.</span></p>
<p class="font15">Yet <span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">growth is achieved by extraordinary high fertility, and not by declining mortality </span><span class="font15">(which is still very high!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Fertility rates in 1800-1850 reach 50 people increase per 1000 </span><span class="font15">per year - </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">the biological limit! </span><span class="font15">(compare: current birth rates in St.&nbsp;Petersburg - 12 people increase per 1000, in Chechnya - 26 per&nbsp;<sup>z</sup> 1000)</span></p>
<p class="font15">Mortality rates in the 18th century - 40-60 per 1000 in the city, 30-</p>
<p class="font15">40 per 1000 in the countryside,</p>
<p class="font15">while in Sweden in the 18th century mortality rates were about 20-30 per 1000.</p>
<p class="font15">Current figures for St. Petersburg - 12 per 1000, for the Russian Federation - 13 per 1000</p>
<p class="font8">France - very low population increase <span class="font9">already in the 19th century</span></p>
<p class="font9">1750-1800 - 3.5 people per 1000 per year</p>
<p class="font9">1800-1850 - 4.3peopleper 1000 per у ear 1850-1900-2.2 people per 1000 per year</p>
<p class="font9">The population of France increased in the 19th century from 29 million to 41 million, while England and Wales - from 9&nbsp;million to 30 million, Germany- from 25 million to 56 million</p>
<p class="font9">Why? - <span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Fertility starts declining very early, almost simultaneously with declining mortality</span><span class="font8"> </span><span class="font9">(presumably because&nbsp;of some forms of birth control)</span></p>
<p class="font15">Countries with the highest rates ot natural population increase - England, Scandinavian countries, Russia, Rumania =</p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">No correlation between industrial development and demographic processes</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Declining mortality rates - </span><span class="font16">as a significant factor of the population growth in 19th century Europe.</span></p>
<p class="font16">The Netherlands:</p>
<p class="font16">1840s - 26.6 deaths/1000 a year</p>
<p class="font16">1900s- 15.7</p>
<p class="font16">Even in the Russian empire mortality started declining in the second half of the 19th century:</p>
<p class="font16">Cities - 1850s- 53 deaths/1000</p>
<p class="font16">1900s-27 deaths/1000</p>
<p class="font16">Countryside - 1850s - from 39 deaths/1000</p>
<p class="font16">1900s - 32 deaths/1000</p>
<p class="font16">(Note: by the early 20th mortality is higher in the countryside, which was not the case even in the&nbsp;mid-19th century!)</p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">How to explain declining mortality?</span></p>
<p class="font16">The impact of <span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">medicine and hygiene </span><span class="font16">affecting the&nbsp;spread of epidemic&nbsp;diseases!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Thomas McKeown, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Modern</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Rise of Population</span><span class="font16"> (1976) -explained the decline in mortality in the 19th century by </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">better living&nbsp;standards and nutritional&nbsp;improvements </span><span class="font16">and not by&nbsp;advances in medicine.</span></p>
<p class="font18">Except for smallpox vaccination (known from the 1720s, perfected&nbsp;by the late 18th century) <span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">mortality&nbsp;caused by epidemic diseases&nbsp;started declining BEFORE significant&nbsp;advances of medicine </span><span class="font18">(Pasteur -1850s, Lister - sterilisation of&nbsp;medical instruments - 1860s, Koch -1870s)</span></p>
<p class="font18">improved nutrition affected the ability of a human body to resist&nbsp;diseases spread by airborne&nbsp;transmission, like ТВ, measles,&nbsp;influenza - their visible decline in&nbsp;the second half of the 19th century&nbsp;before mass vaccination</p>
<p class="font9">Recently historians are increasingly sceptical about McKeown's hypothesis:&nbsp;<span class="font8">no proof that before 1850 nutrition was&nbsp;improving.</span></p>
<p class="font9">A roundabout way to <span class="font8">measure the quality of nutrition - body size of&nbsp;soldiers, </span><span class="font9">they do not always correlate&nbsp;with real wages and </span><span class="font8">do not always&nbsp;demonstrate a tendency to increase.</span></p>
<p class="font9">Urbanisation probably caused lower nutrition standards.</p>
<p class="font8">Increased life expectancy among the elites <span class="font9">in the 18th-19th century was </span><span class="font8">not&nbsp;likely to be caused by improved&nbsp;nutrition.</span></p>
<p class="font17">Even <span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">erroneous medical theories could have prevented the spread of epidemic diseases, </span><span class="font17">since they </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">prompted&nbsp;sanitation reforms:</span></p>
<p class="font17">draining swamps, clearing of city slums,&nbsp;relocation of cemeteries outside of the city limits,&nbsp;sanitary legislation.</p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Reduction of deaths </span><span class="font16">caused by </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">typhus </span><span class="font16">and </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">cholera </span><span class="font16">was important&nbsp;for general decline of mortality&nbsp;rates in </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Water-pipes and sewage, </span><span class="font16">as particularly important</span></p>
<p class="font16">Early water-pipes:</p>
<p class="font16">London - 1720s, sand filters installed in the late 1820s</p>
<p class="font16">Liverpool - late 1780s</p>
<p class="font16">Paris - 1780s (however an integrated system only after 1848)&nbsp;Moscow - 1805</p>
<p class="font16">St. Petersburg - 1859</p>
<p class="font8">Infant mortality - <span class="font9">a key factor </span><span class="font8">determining morality in general&nbsp;and affecting birth rates </span><span class="font9">as well.</span></p>
<p class="font9">It was infant and childhood mortality that declined most&nbsp;conspicuously in the 19th century.&nbsp;Mortality rates among the adults&nbsp;started declining only after 1850.</p>
<p class="font9">Causes of infant mortality - <span class="font8">mostly factors external to human body -</span><span class="font9">infectious diseases, accidents,&nbsp;poisoning... </span><span class="font8">The rise of the ‘child-centred’ family, better maternal&nbsp;care - </span><span class="font9">instrumental for declining&nbsp;infant and childhood mortality</span></p>
<p class="font10">Visible decline in England and Wales, France, Sweden.</p>
<p class="font11">However in Austria, Germany, Russia infant mortality remained&nbsp;high even in the late 19th century.</p>
<p class="font10">Before 1850, infant mortality in Russia was above 300 deaths/1000&nbsp;a year, by the late 19th century -260 deaths/1000 a year. Even in&nbsp;1897 only 57% of new-born babies&nbsp;survived till the age of 5.</p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Declining fertility:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The concept of the demographic transition suggests that birth rates remained stable between 1500 and 1900 - </span><span class="font15">in other&nbsp;words, it was </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">approximating the biological limit </span><span class="font15">and the&nbsp;population did not attempt to control them before 1880.</span></p>
<p class="font18">However it was not exactly the case:</p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">North-Western Europe in the early modem period </span><span class="font18">birth rates stood at 30-40 birth/1000 people a year&nbsp;(biological limit-40-50 births/1000) = </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">below the&nbsp;biological limit. </span><span class="font18">Birth control by </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">late marriages and&nbsp;by a substantial proportion of women who never&nbsp;married </span><span class="font18">(10-25% in the early 19th century)</span></p>
<p class="font18">In the 18th century a married woman of 20-44 y/o had</p>
<p class="font18">9 children in France</p>
<p class="font18">8.6 children in Germany</p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font18">8.5 children in Italy</p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">7J</span><span class="font18"> children in Scandinavia</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p class="font18">7.6 children in England</p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Marriage rates - fairly stable over the period, </span><span class="font13">as two principal factors affecting marriage rates (the age of the&nbsp;first marriage; the share of people who never marry)&nbsp;remain stable or slightly increase in Western and Central&nbsp;Europe. Even in Western Europe, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">before mid-19th century,&nbsp;fertility remained relatively high (although below the&nbsp;biological limit - </span><span class="font13">birth control mostly through delayed&nbsp;marriages).</span></p>
<p class="font13">Two countries with unusual demographic behaviour:</p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">France - low birth rates already by the late 18th century, </span><span class="font13">with fairly standard proportion of people who never marry&nbsp;and an average age of first marriage -&gt; </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">some birth control&nbsp;method are already practiced!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Ireland - </span><span class="font13">very </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">low rates of population increase </span><span class="font13">in the 19th century (4.4/1000 per year in 1800-1850, no increase in&nbsp;1850-1900). Birth rates in marriage are very high but </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;substantial share of the population never marries at all plus&nbsp;late marriages</span></p>
<p class="font18">With exception of France, <span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">fertility rates start declining only from the 1870s-1880s. </span><span class="font18">In Southern Italy or Spain&nbsp;fertility starts declining even later - from the 1930s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Causes - ?</span></p>
<p class="font18">Education and literacy</p>
<p class="font18">Declining infant and child mortality</p>
<p class="font18">Urbanisation</p>
<p class="font18">No direct correlation</p>
<p class="font18">Usually starts in urban environment, however fertility starts declining earlier in rural France than in urban&nbsp;Belgium</p>
<p class="font18">Recent research - no evidence that birth control methods first spread among the middle classes</p>
