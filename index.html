<h1>Economy</h1>
<P class="alert">The impact of economic slowdown was only just beginning to be felt when two external shocks brought the Western European economy to a shuddering halt. On August 15th 1971, US President Richard Nixon unilaterally announced that his coun­ try was abandoning the system of fixed exchange rates. The background to this decision was the huge military burden of the Vietnam War and a growing US Federal budget deficit. The dollar was tied to a gold standard, and there was a growing fear in Washington that for­ eign holders of US currency (including Europe's central banks) would seek to ex­ change their dollars for gold, draining American reserves.
</P>
<P>Following some months of confusion, two successive devaluations of the dol­ lar, and the 'floating' of the British pound in 1972 (belatedly bringing to an inglo­ rious end sterling's ancient and burdensome role as an international 'reserve' currency), a conference in Paris, in March 1973, formally buried the financial arrangements so laboriously erected at Bretton Woods and agreed to establish in its place a new floating-rate system. The cost of this liberalization, predictably enough, was inflation. In the aftermath of the American move of August 1971 (and the subsequent fall in the value of the dollar) European governments, hoping to head off the anticipated economic downturn, adopted deliberately reflationary policies: allowing credit to ease, domestic prices to rise, and their own currencies to fall.
</P>
<P class="alert">This in turn undermined the efforts of individual governments to manipulate local inter­ est rates and maintain the value of their national currency. Currencies fell. And as they fell, so the cost of imports rose: between 1971 and 1973, the world price of non-fuel commodities increased by 70 percent, of food by 100 percent. And it was in this already unstable situation that the international economy was hit by the first of the two oil shocks of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>On October 6th 1973, Yom Kippur (The Day of Atonement) in the Jewish calendar, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel. Within twenty-four hours major Arab oilexporting states had announced plans to reduce oil production; ten days later they announced an oil embargo against the US in retaliation for its support for Israel and increased the price of petroleum by 70 percent. On December 23rd the oil-producing na­ tions agreed to a further increase in the price of oil. One barrel of Saudi light crude—a benchmark measure—cost $1.93 in 1955; in January 1971 it went for just $2.18. Given the modest price inflation of those years, this meant that in real terms oil had actually got cheaper. OPEC, formed in i960, had been largely inert and showed no inclination to constrain its major producers to use their oil reserves as a political weapon. The West had grown accustomed to readily available and re­ markably cheap fuel—a vital component in the long years of prosperity.
</P>
<P class="alert">The consumer boom of the late fifties and sixties had greatly increased Euro­ pean dependence on cheap oil: the tens of millions of new cars on the roads of Western Europe could not run on coal, nor on the electricity now being generated—in France especially—by nuclear power. Hitherto, imported fuel had been priced in fixed dollars. Floating exchange rates and oil price increases thus introduced an unprecedented element of uncertainty. Whereas prices and wages had risen steadily, if moderately, over the course of the previous two decades—an acceptable price for social harmony in an age of rapid growth—monetary inflation now took off. Price and wage inflation at these levels was not historically unprecedented. But after the stable rates of the fifties and sixties it was a new experience for most people—and for their governments. Worse still, the European inflation of the seventies—compounded by a second oil price rise in 1979, when the overthrow of the Shah of Iran produced panic in the oil markets and a 150 percent price increase between December 1979 and May 1980—did not conform to previous experience. In the past, inflation was associated with growth, often over-rapid growth.</P>
<P>The depression of the 1970s seemed worse than it was because of the contrast with what had gone before.By historical standards the average rates of Gross Do­ mestic Product (GDP) growth in western Europe through the 1970s were not es­ pecially low. They ranged from 1.5 percent in the UK to 4.9 percent in Norway and were thus actually a distinct improvement over the 1.3 percent average growth rates achieved by France, Germany and the UK over the years 1913-1950. But they con­ trasted sharply with the figures of the immediate past: from 1950-1973 French growth per annum had averaged 5 percent, West Germany had grown at nearly 6 percent and even Britain had maintained an average rate above 3 percent.</P>
<P>It was not the 1970s that were unusual so much as the '50s and '60s. It was not the 1970s that were unusual so much as the 50s and 60s.3 Nevertheless, the pain was real, made worse by growing export competition from new industrial countries in Asia and ever more costly import bills as com­ modities (and not just oil) increased in price.</P>
<P class="alert">Unemployment rates started to rise, steadily but inexorably. One immediate result of the economic down-turn was a hardening of attitudes towards 'foreign workers of all sorts. If published unemployment rates in West Ger­ many (close to zero in 1970) did not climb above 8 percent of the labor force de­ spite a slump in demand for manufactured goods, it was because most of the unemployed workers in Germany were not German—and thus not officially recorded. Voluntarily or otherwise, many of them did indeed return 'home'. In 1975, 290,000 immigrant workers and their families left West Germany for Turkey, Yu­goslavia, Greece and Italy.
By the midseventies, nearly a third of a million Yugoslav emigrants had been obliged to return to the Balkans, where their expectation of employment was no better than in Ger­many or France. The combination of structural unemployment, rising oil import bills, inflation and declining exports led to budget deficits and payments crises all across Western Europe.
</P>
<P class="alert">In the course of a generation, Western Europe had undergone a third 'industrial revolution'; the smokestack industries that had been so much a part of daily life just a few years before were on their way out. If steelworkers, miners, car workers and mill hands were losing jobs, it wasn't just because of a cyclical down­ turn in the local economy, or even a by-product of the oil crisis. The venerable man­ ufacturing economy of Western Europe was disappearing. The number of miners had been slip­ ping steadily ever since West European coal output peaked in the 1950s: the great Sambre-Meuse mining basin of southern Belgium, which generated 20.5 million tonnes of coal in 1955, produced just six million tonnes by 1968 and negligible amounts ten years later. Between 1955 and 1985 100,000 mining jobs disappeared in Belgium; Steel, the other staple industry of industrial Europe, suffered a similar fate. It was not that demand for steel had fallen so very dramatically—unlike coal, it could not so readily be replaced. But as more non-European countries entered the industrial ranks, competition increased, the price fell and the market for expensively produced European steel collapsed. Between 1974 and 1986 British steelworkers lost 166,000 jobs (though in the latter year the UK's major manufacturer, the British Steel Cor­poration, made a profit for the first time in over a decade). Shipbuilding declined for similar reasons. The recession of the Seventies saw an acceleration of job losses in virtually every traditional industry. Before 1973 the transformation was already under way in coal, iron, steel, engineering; thereafter it spread to chemicals, textiles, paper and con­ sumer goods. Whole regions were traumatized: between 1973 and 1981 the British West Midlands, home of small engineering firms and car plants, lost one in four of its workforce. The industrial zone of Lorraine, in north-west France, lost 28 per­ cent of its manufacturing jobs. The industrial workforce in Lüneburg, West Ger­ many, fell by 42 percent in the same years. When FIAT of Turin began its switch to robotization at the end of the 1970s, 65,000 jobs (out of a total of 165,000) were lost in just three years.
</P>
<P class="alert">In the past, the social cost of economic change on this scale, and at this pace, would have been traumatic, with unpredictable political consequences. Thanks to the institutions of the welfare state—and perhaps the diminished political enthu­ siasms of the time—protest was contained. But it was far from absent. In the years 1969-1975 there were angry marches, sit-ins, strikes and petitions all across indus­ trial Western Europe. The decline in the number of workers in old industries had shifted the balance of strength in trade union movements to the service-sector unions, whose con­ stituency was rapidly growing. In Italy, even as the older, Communist-led indus­ trial organizations lost members, teachers and civil service unions grew in size and militancy.
The old unions evinced scant sympathy for the unemployed: most were anxious above all to preserve jobs (and their own influence) and shied away from open confrontations.
</P>
<P>Ailing industries—steel especially—were taken under the wing of the state, much as in the initial round of post-war nationalizations: in the UK the 'Steel Plan' of 1977 saved the industry from collapse by cartelizing its price structure and effectively abolishing local price competition. By the mid-seventies one holding company, Ruhrkohle AG, was responsible for 95 percent of the mining output of the Ruhr district. What remained of the domestic textile industries of France and Britain was preserved, for the sake of the jobs it offered in depressed regions, by substantial direct job subsidies (paying employers to keep on workers they didn't need) and protective measures against third-world imports. There were national variations in these responses to economic downturn. The French authorities pursued a practice of micro-economic intervention, identifying 'national champions' by sector and favoring them with contracts, cash and guarantees; whereas the UK Treasury continued its venerable tradition of macroeconomic manipulation through taxes, interest rates and blanket subsidies. But what is striking is how little variation there was along political lines. German and Swedish Social Democrats, Italian Christian Democrats, French Gaullists and British politicians of every stripe instinctively clung at first to the post-war consensus: seeking full employment if possible, compensating in its absence with wage increases for those in work, social transfers for those out of work and cash subsidies for ailing employers in private and public sector alike.
</P>
<P class="alert">As we have noted, the instinctive reaction of politicians everywhere was to assuage the anxieties of the blue-collar male proletariat: partly because they were the worst affected, but mostly because precedent suggested that this was the social constituency most likely to mount effective protests. But as it transpired, the real opposition lay elsewhere. It was the heavily-taxed middle classes—white-collar public and private employees, small tradesmen and the selfemployed—whose troubles translated most effectively into political opposition. The greatest beneficiaries of the modern welfare state, after all, were the middle classes. When the post-war system started to unravel in the 1970s it was those same middle classes who felt not so much threatened as cheated: by inflation, by taxfinanced subsidies to failing industries and by the reduction or elimination of pub­ lic services to meet budgetary and monetary constraints.
</P>
<P>Then there was the more immediate anxiety born of job losses and inflation, about which governments seemed helpless to act.
Like De Gaulle (in May 1968), some senior British political figures in these years thought it prudent to meet with police and military leaders to reas­ sure themselves of their support in the event of public disorder.
Even in Scandinavia and the Low Countries, where the core legitimacy of representative institutions was never seriously called into question, the disarray of the world fi­ nancial system, the apparent unraveling of the post-war economy and the disaf­ fection of traditional electorates called into question the easy confidence of the post-war generation.
</P>
<P>Behind these nebulous stirrings of doubt and disillusion there was a very real and, as it seemed at the time, present threat. Since the end of the Second World War, Western Europe had been largely preserved from civil conflict, much less open violence.
But Western Europe had been an is­ land of civil peace. When European policemen did beat or shoot civilians, the latter were usually foreigners, often dark-skinned.
As for the student 'riots' of the Sixties, they served, if anything, to confirm this diagnosis: Europe's youth might play at revolution but it was mostly show. The 'street-fighting men' ran little risk of actually getting hurt.
>In short, Communism and Fascism, in their classic incarnations, had no future in Western Europe. The real threat to civic peace came from another direc­ tion altogether.
</P>
<h1>Policy</h1>
<P>In the course of the 1970s, Western European society faced two violent challenges. The first of these was pathological, in the sense that it was born of a longstanding malaise, albeit cast in a very modern form. In the Basque region of northern Spain, in the Catholic minority of Northern Ireland, in Corsica and elsewhere, old griev­ ances flared into violent revolt.
</P>
<P class="ni">By 1970 the problem of the South Tyrol had been resolved by the creation of an autonomous bi-lingual region which appeased all but the most extreme crit­ ics; and although the Flemish nationalists of the Volksunie and Vlaams Blok par­ ties never abandoned their ultimate goal of separation from French-speaking Wallonia, the new prosperity of Flanders, together with far-reaching legislation to federalize Belgium, had temporarily removed the sting from their demands: from a resentful pariah movement Flemish nationalism had been transformed into a re­ volt of Dutch-speaking taxpayers reluctant to subsidize unemployed Walloon steelworkers (see Chapter 22).
</P>
<P>The Basques and the Ulster Catholics, however, were another matter altogether. The Basque country of northern Spain had always been a particular target of Franco's ire: partly because of its identification with the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War, partly because the Basques' longstanding demand to be recog­ nized as different ran counter to the deepest centralizing instincts and self-ascribed, state-preserving role of the Spanish officer corps. Anything and everything dis­ tinctively Basque was aggressively repressed throughout the Franco years: language, customs, politics.
</P>
<P class="alert">The emergence of modern Basque terrorism was a direct response to Franco's policies, though its spokesmen and defenders always claimed deeper roots in their region's frustrated dreams of independence. ETA—Euskadi TaAskatasuna (Basquia and Freedom)—was formed in December 1958 to lead the armed struggle for Basque independence. From its earliest days as an underground organization it established working links—later given somewhat specious ideological justification— with similar groups abroad, who helped it secure money, weapons, training, safe havens and publicity: the Baader-Meinhof Group in Germany, the Irish Republican Army, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, as well as the OAS in France. The strategy of ETA—and its political supporters in Herri Batasuna, the Basque separatist party formed in 1978—was a straightforward one of instrumental violence: to raise the price of keeping Basques in Spain to a politically intolerable level.
</P>
<P>In the waning years of the Franco era, ETA's activities were restricted by the very repression that had led to its emergence: by the end of the dictatorship, in the early 1970s, one quarter of Spain's armed police were stationed in the Basque country alone. This did not prevent ETA from assassinating Franco's Prime Minister (Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco) in Madrid on December 20th 1973, or killing twelve civilians in a bomb attack in the capital nine months later.
</P>
<P class="alert">The coming of democracy, on the other hand, offered new opportunities. ETA and its supporters wanted full independence. What the Basque region got, under Spain's post-Franco constitution (see Chapter 16), was a Statute of Autonomy, approved by referendum in 1979. Infuriated—not least at the prospect of losing the support of moderate sympathizers satisfied by self-government and the right to linguistic and cultural self-expression—ETA stepped up its campaigns of bombing and assassination.
</P>
<P class="alert">One reason for ETA's limited impact, despite the horrific scale and wide public impact of its killing sprees, was that most Basques identified neither with its means nor with its ends. By the mid-eighties, less than half the population of the Basque region had Basque parents, much less Basque grand­ parents. Such people rightly saw ETA and Herri Batasuna as a threat to their wellbeing (and implicitly to their very presence in the region).
</P>
<P>The Provisional IRA was much like ETA in its methods, and in some of its pro­ claimed objectives. Just as ETA sought to make the Basque provinces ungovernable and thereby secure their exit from Spain, so the Irish Republican Army aimed at making Northern Ireland ungovernable, expellingJhe British, and uniting the six northern provinces with the rest of Ireland. But there were significant differences. Since an independent Ireland already existed, there was—at least in principle—a practicable national goal for the rebels to hold out to their supporters.
</P>
<P>Like French Algeria, Northern Ireland—Ulster—was both a colonial remnant and an integral part of the metropolitan nation itself. When London finally relin­ quished Ireland to the Irish, in 1922, the UK retained the six northern counties of the island on the reasonable enough grounds that the overwhelmingly Protestant majority there was intensely loyal to Britain and had no desire to be governed from Dublin—and incorporated into a semi-theocratic republic dominated by the Catholic episcopate.
</P>
<P>But for a minor­ity of Irish nationalists this abandonment constituted a betrayal, and under the banner of the IRA they continued to demand the unification—by force if need be— of the entire island. This situation remained largely unchanged for four decades. By the 1960s the of­ ficial stance in Dublin somewhat resembled that of Bonn: acknowledging the de­ sirability of national re-unification but quietly content to see the matter postponed sine die. Successive British governments, meanwhile, had long chosen to ignore so far as possible the uneasy situation they had inherited in Ulster, where the Protes­ tant majority dominated local Catholics through gerrymandered constituencies, political clientelism, sectarian pressure on employers, and a monopoly of jobs in crucial occupations: civil service, judiciary and above all the police.
</P>
<P>But the Catholic/Protestant divide was never a class distinction in the conventional sense, despite the IRA's efforts to import Marxist categories into its rhetoric. There were workers and priests—and to a lesser extent landowners, businessmen and professionals—on both sides. Moreover, many Ulster Catholics felt no urgent desire to be ruled from Dublin.
</P>
<P>Even for Catholics, Ulster was a better economic bet. Protestants, meanwhile, identified very strongly with the UK. As a ref­erendum of March 1973 showed and later polls confirmed, an overwhelming ma­jority of the people of Ulster wished to maintain their ties to Britain. The IRA campaign did not unite Ireland.
</P>
<P>But the Irish 'Troubles' further darkened an already gloomy decade in British public life and contributed to the 'ungovernability' thesis being touted at the time, as well as to the end of the carefree optimism of the 1960s. By the time the Provisional IRA—and the Protestant paramilitary groups that had emerged in its wake—finally came to the negotiating table, to secure constitutional arrange­ ments that the British government might have been pleased to concede almost from the outset, 1,800 people had been killed and one Ulster resident in five had a family member killed or wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>In one key or another, all such protests and actions were, as I have suggested, pathologies of politics: however extreme their form, their goals were familiar and their tactics instrumental. They were trying to achieve something and would—by their own account—have desisted if their demands were met. ETA, the IRA and their imitators were terrorist organizations; but they were not irrational. In due course most of them ended up negotiating with their enemies, in the hope of se­ curing their objectives if only in part.
</P>
<P class="alert">In most of Western Europe, the airy radical theorems of the 1960s dissipated harmlessly enough. But in two countries in particular they metamorphosed into a psychosis of self-justifying aggression. A small minority of erstwhile student rad­ icals, intoxicated by their own adaptation of Marxist dialectics, set about 'reveal­ ing' the 'true face' of repressive tolerance in Western democracies.The urge to bring the architec­ture of security and stability crashing down on the heads of their parents' generation was the extreme expression of a more widespread skepticism, in the light of the recent past, about the local credibility of pluralist democracy. It was not by chance, therefore, that 'revolutionary terror' took its most menacing form in Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>The link between extra-parliamentary politics and outright violence first emerged in Germany as early as April 1968, when four young radicals—among them Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin—were arrested on suspicion of burn­ ing two department stores in Frankfurt. Two years later Baader escaped from prison in the course of an armed raid planned and led by Ulrike Meinhof. She and Baader then issued their 'Concept City Guerrilla Manifesto', announcing the formation of a 'Rote Armee Fraktion' (Red Army Fraction—RAF) whose goal was to dismantle the Federal Republic by force. The acronym RAF was chosen deliberately: just as Britain's Royal Air Force had attacked Nazi Germany from the air, so the BaaderMeinhof Group, as they were colloquially known, would bomb and shoot its suc­ cessor into submission from below.
</P>
<P>Between 1970 and 1978, the RAF and its ancillary offshoots pursued a strategy of deliberately random terror, assassinating soldiers, policemen and businessmen, holding up banks and kidnapping mainstream politicians. Since the German terrorist underground had no defined goals, its achievements can only be measured by the extent of its success in disrupting German public life and undermining the institutions of the Republic. Neither the terrorist Left nor the apparently renascent neo-Nazi Right—notably responsible for killing 13 people and wounding 220 others in a bomb attack on Mu­ nich's Oktoberfest in 1980—succeeded in destabilizing the Republic, although they did provoke careless talk in conservative political circles of the need to curb civil liberties and enforce 'Order'.
</P>
<P class="alert">Just as the Red Army Fraktion claimed to be fighting 'Fascism'—by proxy, so to speak—so West Germany's intellectuals, Left and Right, battled for control of Ger­ many's true heritage. Syberberg's fellow film director Edgar Reitz directed a hugely popular, sixteen-hour television mini-series: 'Heimat: A German Chronicle'. The story of a family from the Hunsrück countryside of the Rhineland Palatinate, it traced contemporary German history through a domestic narrative reaching from the end of World War One to the present.
</P>
<P>The implicit relativizing of Nazism in <i>Deutschland im Herbst</i> was already be­ coming quite explicit in intellectual apologias for anti-capitalist terror. >On September 5th 1972, the Palestinian organization Black September attacked the Israeli team at the Munich Olympics and killed eleven athletes, as well as one German policeman. Almost certainly, the killers had local assistance from the rad­ ical Left (though it is a curiousity of German extremist politics of the time that the far Right would have been no less pleased to offer its services). The link between Palestinian organizations and European terrorist groups was already well established—Ensslin, Baader and Meinhof all 'trained' at one time with Palestin­ ian guerillas, along with Basques, Italians, Irish Republicans and others.</P>
<p>But only Germans went the extra mile: when four gunmen (two Germans, two Arabs) hi­jacked an Air France plane in June 1976 and flew it to Entebbe, in Uganda, it was the Germans who undertook to identify and separate the Jewish passengers from the rest.
If this action, so unmistakably reminiscent of selections of Jews by Germans in another time and place, did not definitively discredit the Baader-Meinhof gang in the eyes of its sympathizers it was because its arguments, if not its methods, at­ tracted quite broad consent: Germans, not Jews, were now the victims; and Amer­ican capitalism, not German National Socialism, was the perpetrator. 'War crimes' were now things that Americans did to—e.g.—Vietnamese.
</P>
<P class="alert">In external respects, contemporary Italian terrorism was not markedly differ­ent from the German kind. It too drew on para-Marxist rhetoric from the Sixties, and most of its leaders received their political education in the university protests of that time. But there were also some important differences. From the outset, Italian Left ter­ rorists placed far greater emphasis upon their purported relationship to the 'work­ers'; and indeed in certain industrial towns of the north, Milan in particular, the more respectable fringes of the ultra-Left did have a small popular following. Un­ like the German terrorists, grouped around a tiny hard core of criminals, the Ital­ ian far Left ranged from legitimate political parties through urban guerrilla networks to micro-sects of armed political bandits, with a fair degree of overlap in membership and objectives.
</P>
<P>Between 1970 and 1981 not a year passed in Italy without murders, mutilations, kidnapping, assaults and sundry acts of public vio­lence. In the course of the decade three politicians, nine magistrates, sixty-five po­licemen and some three hundred others fell victim to assassination. But by the mid-seventies they had progressed to political assassination—at first of right-wing politicians, then policemen, journalists and public prosecutors—in a strategy designed to 'strip away the mask' of bourgeois legality, force the state into violent repression and thus polarize public opinion. On May 10th Aldo Moro's body was found in a car brazenly parked on a street in the centre of Rome.
</P>
<P>It was now clear to everyone that Italy faced a real challenge to its political order: less than two weeks after Moro's corpse was found, the BR killed the head of the anti-terrorist squad in Genoa; in October 1978 they assassinated the Director General of Penal Affairs in Rome's Justice Ministry. Two weeks later the Formazione Comuniste Combattenti assassinated a senior pub­ lic prosecutor. But the very scale of the terrorists' challenge to the state now began to extract a price. The Italian Communist Party threw its weight firmly and unambiguously be­ hind the institutions of the Republic, making explicit what was by now clear to al­ most everyone: namely, that whatever their roots in popular movements of the Sixties, the terrorists of the Seventies had now placed themselves beyond the spec­ trum of radical politics.
</P>
<P class="alert">The idea that political violence might have the 'productive force of selfaffirmation' was not unfamiliar in modern Italian history, of course. What Negri was affirming, and what the Red Brigades and their friends were practicing, was no different from the 'cleansing power of force' as exalted by Fascists. As in Germany, so in Italy: the far Left's hatred of the 'bourgeois state' had led it back to the 'pro­ letarian' violence of the anti-democratic Right.
</P>
<P>But to the extent that the re-emergence of neo-Fascist terror and the resurgence of Mafia violence illustrated and exacerbated the vulnerability of democratic in­ stitutions, their undertakings were—perhaps correctly—interpreted by Left ter­ rorists as a sign of their own success.
</P>
<P>All the mainstream political organizations of the Left, Communists especially, were constrained to take and maintain their distance from violence of any kind. Partly this was a spontaneous response to the threat terror posed to them as well as others—trade unionists and other representatives of the traditional labor move­ ment were among the most vilified targets of the underground networks.
</P>
<P class="alert">Most young people were now less concerned with changing the world than with finding a job: the fascination with collective ambitions gave way to an obsession with personal needs. In a more threat­ ening world, securing one's self-interest took precedence over advancing com­mon causes.
</P>
<h1>Culture</h1>
<P>Whereas the Sixties were marked by the naive, self-congratulatory impulse to believe that every­ thing happening was new—and everything new was significant—the Seventies were an age of cynicism, of lost illusions and reduced expectations. When applied to categories of thought—as in 'post-Marxist', 'post-structuralist' and, most elusively of all, 'post-modern'—it merely added to the obscurities of an already confused time.
</P>
<P class="alert">The culture of the Seventies turned not on the collective but the individual. Just as anthropology had displaced philosophy as the Ur-discipline of the Sixties, so psy­ chology now took its place. In the course of the Sixties the notion of 'false con­ sciousness' had been widely taken up by young Marxists to explain the failure of workers and others to liberate themselves from identification with the capitalist in­ terest. In a perverted variant this idea formed, as we have seen, the core premise of Left terrorism. But it also took on a curious afterlife in less politicized circles: adapt­ ing Marxist background language to Freudian subjects, self-styled 'post-Freudians' now emphasized the need to liberate not social classes but aggregated individ­ ual subjects.
</P>
<P>They were not much concerned with traditional projects of social revolution (which the feminists correctly identified with political move­ments led by and primarily for men). Instead they sought to undermine the very concept of the human subject that had once underlain them. At the time, this account of the human condition was widely and correctly as­ sociated with the writings of Michel Foucault. But for all his occasional obscuran­tism Foucault was a rationalist at heart. His early writings tracked quite closely the venerable Marxist claim that in order to liberate workers from the shackles of cap­ italism one had first to substitute a different account of history and economics for the self-serving narrative of bourgeois society. In short, one had to substitute rev­ olutionary knowledge, so to speak, for that of the masters: or, in the language of Antonio Gramsci so fashionable a few years earlier, one had to combat the 'hege­ mony' of the ruling class.
</P>
<P class="alert">With a ready-made audience in the universities, newly lionised theorists like Lacan and Derrida elevated the vagaries and paradoxes of language into full-fledged philosophies, infinitely flexible templates for textual and political explication. As Stuart Hall, the leading British spokesman for Cultural Stud­ ies in those years, expressed it in 1976: «The idea of the disappearance of the class as a whole» is replaced by the far more complex and differentiated picture of how the different sectors and strata of a class are driven into different courses and op­ tions by their determining socio-economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>Even the sparkling originality of 1960s French cinema declined into self-conscious artistry. In 1974 Jacques Rivette, the witty and original director of Paris Nous Appartient (i960) and La Religieuse (1966), directed Céline et Julie vont en bateau ('Céline and Julie Go Boating'). At 193 minutes in length, a plot-less, stylized parody (albeit un­ intended) of the French New Wave, Céline et Julie marked the end of an age. Artis­tic theorizing was displacing art.
</P>
<P class="alert">Much as popular romances and tabloid journalism had once fastened on to mass literacy for commercial advantage, so 'punk' rock appeared in the Seventies in order to exploit the market for popular music. Presented as 'counter-cultural' it was in fact parasitic upon mainstream cul­ ture, invoking violent images and radical language for frequently mercenary ends. Musical subversion now con­ sisted of angry songs decrying 'hegemony', their counterfeit political content mask­ ing the steady evisceration of musical form.
