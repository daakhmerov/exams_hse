<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">Family histories of the British Empire are seen by most historians as continuous narratives, perpetuated through the constant renewal of ties between colony and homeland until the late 1940s or the early 1950s.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark1">1</a></sup><sup> </sup>Family histories of German colonialism, in contrast, are marked by the same breaks that we have seen accompanying public memory: the loss of the colonies at the end of the First World War, another military defeat and humanitarian crisis at the end of the Second World War, the reconsideration of imperial pasts in the 1968 student movement, and, finally, reunification. Despite these breaks, however, families involved in the German colonial project were and still are able to construct a cogent narrative involving colonial actors within the private sphere by passing on colonial memory both literally and figuratively as a family heirloom. This chapter will show what sort of private memory of colonialism still exists in these families and in what forms, through what media this memory is transmitted to the next generation, how the memory of the colonial past is shaped by ruptures such as the National Socialist period, and how public and private memories are intertwined in recollections and evocations of German colonialism. Finally, a case study will be presented of an intergenerational encounter with colonial memory within one family whose very identity has been shaped by German colonialism.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">In contrast to the subjects of recent historical work on empire families’, which draws on the recollections of active members of the British Empire, German colonial actors can no longer be questioned about their experiences. Even if a young man had turned eighteen on the day the last German force capitulated in Africa, which was a tiny part of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe</span><span class="font2"> in German East Africa in 1918, he would now be well over one hundred years old. Yet, as previous chapters have shown, German public interest in colonial revisionism was widespread in politics and popular culture well beyond the period of colonialism itself.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">The central question in this chapter is what aspects of German colonialism are deemed most important to a contemporary collective’—a family—over time, or what elements, in the historian Reinhart Koselleck’s terms, re-emerge from the pastness’ of the occurrence and are ‘articulated anew’.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark2">2</a></sup><sup></sup> In interviews conducted to form part of the source base, informants were asked about family heirlooms—stories and anecdotes on the one hand and material ‘relics’ of the colonial past on the other—that were passed down to them through the generations descending from colonial actors themselves. Koselleck’s ‘past presence’, or ‘what really happened’ during the colonial period, is thus important in this study insofar as it is reconfigured in the ‘present past’ and is thought to change or endure as it moves to the ‘future past’.<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark3">3</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark4">4</a></sup>&nbsp;By asking detailed questions about the origins of the oral and material elements of memory still </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">present,</span><span class="font2"> one is eventually able to disentangle the strands of German colonialism important to each generation before they were added to a larger canon of family ‘history’. Together with orally transmitted memory, these material elements form a unique ‘family archive’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">In Germany, colonial memory transcends four generations, in the sense of Karl Mannheim’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erlebnisgemeinschafien.<sup>/</sup>'</span><span class="font2"> Each generation is defined by external events occurring in the prime of their lives, from young adulthood to middle age, events which determine a shared collective identity. These include, first, the original ‘long’ generation of colonial actors, born between the 1850s and 1880s, who helped set up the German empire abroad; secondly, their ‘decolonized’ children, born between the 1890s and 1910s, many of whom became a second generation of‘colonial-like’ actors in the former colonies; thirdly, the ‘postcolonials’, born between the 1920s and 1940s; and, lasdy, the ‘extra-colonials’, born between the 1950s and 1970s. The temporal divisions are approximate, as families have their own reproductive patterns. What is important, however, is the distinctions between the group of actors who were involved in constructing empire, the generation who grew up after the overseas empire was just lost, the one who lived through or participated in the Second World War, and the one born after the Second World War and after large-scale decolonization. As we will see, each generations understanding of German colonialism is dependent upon their experience of other aspects of German history.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 32pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">The spread of colonial actors which are the subjects of the interviews in this chapter reflects the various capacities in which Germans travelled to the colonies. It includes explorers, members of the colonial army, government administrators, nurses, household helps, and farmers. To be sure, missionaries also played an important role in German presence in the colonies; however, they made up a relatively small proportion of the total number of settlers and are thus not reflected in this discussion.<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark5">5</a></sup><sup></sup> It was not always possible to interview direct descendants of colonial actors. For one thing, male colonial officials had a tendency not to reproduce, since the tropical climate overseas was often not deemed suitable for European families. Another reason is that many colonialists came from traditional military families, so their sons also joined the military and were killed during the First or Second World War. This was the case for General Lothar von Trotha, Friedrich von Lindequist, a former Governor of German Southwest Africa and successor to Bernhard Dernburg as State Secretary of the Reich Colonial Office, and Jesko von Puttkamer, a former Governor of Kamerun.<a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">6</a></sup><sup></sup> Given these limitations, the results nevertheless reflect vividly the interaction between elements of private, family memory and public memory of German colonialism, both of which have become part of the fabric of German family histories.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">THE HISTORY MAKERS—COLONIAL ACTORS’ FORMING OF FAMILY MEMORY</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">Part of the responsibility for constructing a lasting family memory of colonialism rests with colonial actors themselves. The first generation was concerned with literally and metaphorically making their mark on the colonial landscape. Much of their legacy was a defence against critics of colonialism, ranging from those morally opposed to the subjugation of indigenous peoples to—what was more often the case—those who thought overseas empire was simply a waste of finances.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">For the majority of its members, colonialism was by and large considered to be a civilizing mission. Many colonial actors accepted violence as a legitimate and necessary evil in order to fulfil this duty, the white man’s burden. This was, however, combined with a genuine, almost anthropological interest in native peoples and customs. As much as some members of this generation terrorized indigenous peoples and forcibly ‘Europeanized’ the landscape, they were also enraptured by the colonial ‘other’. They brought back objects from overseas—objects of fascination, education, ornament, and, above all, mnemonic artefacts to be displayed in museums and in German homes. A young soldier in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe,</span><span class="font2"> Heinrich Meyer, for example, brought back a Hereto woman’s headdress and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kirri,</span><span class="font2"> or hunting stick. All of the objects Meyer imported to Germany, as well as his uniform, were lost during the Second World War, as the family fled its home in Leipzig. In fact, the only things that survived the war were Meyer’s diary, a photo of him in his desert uniform, and his ration book.<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark7">7</a></sup><sup></sup> Meyer’s penchant for collecting may have been just a personal idiosyncrasy. However, the enthusiasm for all things Southwest African that he passed on to family suggests that the former dispatch rider was trying to establish a personal ‘archive’ of what were essentially objects of memory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Others returned with hunting trophies. The author and artist Thea de Haas, for example, described the efforts she undertook in order to bring home a lion skin from East Africa: ‘Later, in the war, I dragged the lion skin across the colony and, in spite of imprisonment... brought it home with me. Today it hangs, to the joy of our boys, over their [American] Indian wigwam and often, often upon seeing it I think of the lost and now locked paradise.’<a name="footnote8"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">8</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">These objects of memory from Africa can be interpreted in at least two ways. As Russell Berman notes, ‘alterity... is at the core (not the margins) of colonial discourse; the possibility of exploring the world and experiencing something new’.<a name="footnote9"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">9</a></sup><sup></sup> In line with Berman’s argument that some Germans were curious about, rather than immediately dismissive of, difference, ethnographic objects brought back by colonial actors may show how engagements with alterity made their way into the familiar confines of the home. This is certainly true for objects brought back for museums by anthropologists, ethnographers, and missionaries, perhaps also for curious youths like Meyer. In fact, it may be true for much of the colonialist generation that transported the objects to Germany in the first place in order to hold on to a memory—their memory—of life abroad. Yet arguably most objects brought back for the private home ended up serving a different purpose: that of ornament. Over the years, as meanings tied to objects dissipated, what was inserted into bourgeois German homes from Africa and other colonial spheres had less to do with issues of knowledge and power than with issues of aesthetics. This process to some extent mirrors a similar discursive turn in the world of professional ethnographic collectors: what was at first a means of acquiring knowledge for Enlightenment ideals of comparative humanity became in the course of the twentieth century a desire to collect for the sheer pleasure of possessing.<a name="footnote10"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark10">10</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 33pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">Bringing back artefacts from abroad and telling their stories—whether written or oral—were thus important ways in which colonial actors laid the foundations for a memory of empire. Keeping this alive, however, depended on subsequent generations.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">CONTINUITIES AND DISCONTINUITIES IN ‘DECOLONIZED’ MEMORY MAKING</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">Although most historians date the end of ‘the German colonial dream’ to the reorientation of German military and political strategy to the East in 1944,<a name="footnote11"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark11">11</a></sup><sup></sup> this does not hold true for colonial actors themselves, nor for their progeny. In a letter written in March 1945 to the former Governor of East Africa, Heinrich Schnee, Friedrich von Lindequist lamented:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 14pt;"><span class="font1">What is to become of our beautiful colonies? I especially miss East and Southwest Africa. Four days ago I received a paper on farming and settlement in S.WA. for review from the Foreign Office... I often receive word from Exz. Seitz [Theodor Seitz, Governor of Kamerun 1907-10, Governor of German Southwest Africa 1910-15].<a name="footnote12"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark12">12</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">Besides highlighting the salience of colonial memories and nostalgia among colonial actors themselves, Lindequist’s letter raises another important issue, namely, that German colonial actors continued to keep in touch through informal social networks long after the colonies had been ceded to the Allies.<a name="footnote13"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark13">13</a></sup><sup></sup> This obviously had an effect on their families as well, as the ‘decolonized’ generation was drawn into these circles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">After Heinrich Meyer returned to Germany from Southwest Africa, he immediately wanted to go back to Germany’s ‘place in the sun. No longer needed as a soldier, however, he was released from the colonial army and began a career as a revenue officer. He married in 1913, and the couple started making plans to emigrate. Everything was in place by 1914, but the dream burst with the beginning of the First World War in August of that year. Meyer never went back; instead, he continued his dreaming of Africa to the fullest in Germany. Determined to promote the colonial idea, he purchased a series of slides, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lichtbilder,</span><span class="font2"> in Berlin—a widespread form of entertainment and propaganda at the time. He used these slides not only in public lectures around the country, but also in presentations to his family, erasing the boundaries between public and private forms of memory. Meyer’s daughter, Anneliese Gartner, born 1918, remembers looking at these slide presentations on a big screen in their house with her two siblings and mother. Although expected to be obedient and watch the presentations, the children were also genuinely fascinated by the pictures and facts about the landscape, ‘natives’, and history of the region. As Gartner explains: ‘of course I absorbed all of this as a child, and that’s why I know so much today’.<a name="footnote14"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">14</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Meyer also shared his enthusiasm for the former colonies with a close circle of like-minded friends who were from time to time invited into the home. He wrote colonial-themed plays with titles like ‘By the Campfire’ and ‘Christmas at the Waterberg’ for Christmas parties, colonial memorial days, or other events in the local community. Gartner and her siblings were often recruited as actors for smaller roles in these productions. The nationalist tenor of such performances is perhaps best expressed in a play called ‘Germania’s Children, a kind of tableau vivant in which different characters, including a member of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe,</span><span class="font2"> a sailor, and a ‘native’ ask Germania—played by a popular theatre actress in Leipzig—to grant them their wishes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Meyer never quite let go of the dream of the former German Southwest Africa, and in 1973 a series of his poems and plays were published in a compilation dedicated to the ‘memory of my comrades who lived, worked, and died in Southwest Africa and the other German territories overseas’.<a name="footnote15"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">15</a></sup><sup></sup> One of these was the play ‘Elisabeth’, first performed in Leipzig in 1923 and narrating the fortunes of a woman forced to leave Southwest Africa during the First World War. The play was dedicated to the first president of the Colonial War Heroes Association, General Georg Maercker, in memory of his wife Elsbeth, who, according to the dedication, died ‘lonely... on June 27, 1922 in her lost </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heimat</span><span class="font2"> Bromberg’. If we take Elsbeth Maercker to be the real-life inspiration for Meyer’s Elisabeth, the conflation between the lost </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heimat</span><span class="font2"> in Southwest Africa and the lost </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heimat</span><span class="font2"> in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), which was ceded to Poland after the First World War, is telling. It shows how colonial actors even before the National Socialist period drew parallels between German colonies overseas and the spread of the German Empire in the East. These two zones of German projections of empire were to become even more conflated during the years of National Socialism. What binds them together in private memory during the interwar period, however, is not a common thread of racial theory and cultural dominance, but rather a common sense of loss.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:13pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">Although usually keeping to smaller, locally based groups, Meyer’s work promoting the memory of the former colonies also had ramifications on a national level. As a leader in his circles, Meyer often met with later presidents of the Colonial War Heroes Association as well, including the famous Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. During the interwar period, colonial interest groups were bound together not only by a common purpose and common fascination with the former colonies, but also by a shared sense of loss that was passed on directly to the decolonized generation. This is how Gartner, for example, explains her father’s enthusiasm and nostalgia for the former colonies:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 13pt;"><span class="font1">It wasn’t just my father who was angry, rather, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diktat</span><span class="font1"> of Versailles stated Germans’ inability to colonize, and that of course brought all these men once more to the barricades. They said: we won’t take this. And that happened in the most diverse German cities—in Bochum, in Berlin, in Leipzig, in Erfurt, in Bremen, Dortmund, or Dusseldorf—groups were formed, more like fellowships, like today in shooting clubs, who more or less maintained their stories and their companionship. The first few years there were still a lot of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppen.</span><span class="font1"> It didn’t take five minutes for them to have turned the conversation to Africa.<a name="footnote16"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark16">16</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">Their sense of loss and the mission to overcome it also fuelled the imagination and enthusiasm of Gartner’s generation. Gartner, for example, joined the Colonial Youth (KJ) in Leipzig. This was a group of forty to fifty girls and boys who met to talk and learn about the former colonies. They went to lectures and seminars at the commercial college and visited an experimental farm in the area that grew native African plants. Holding on to cultural traditions as well, they sang songs like the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sudwesterlied,</span><span class="font2"> which starts with the romantically inspired lines: ‘Hard as camel thorn wood is our land/And dry are our riverbeds’; and climaxes in the refrain: ‘And if you should ask us/What keeps us here?/We can only say/We love Southwest!’<a name="footnote17"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">17</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:17pt;"><span class="font2">For these children, then, the dream of regaining the former colonies was kept alive in Germany in very real manifestations. In 1933 the KJ, the Colonial Scouts, and other colonial youth groups were merged into the Hitler Youth (HJ). Although the Women’s League of the German Colonial Society retained some control over the girls’ colonial groups, by and large the organizations were from now on controlled by the Nazi Party, a clear blow to the conservative colonial circles.<a name="footnote18"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark18">18</a></sup><sup></sup> According to Reich Youth Leader Baldur von Schirach, members of the HJ were supposed to learn about the former German colonies to the extent that they could recognize the economic importance of raw materials exported from the overseas territories. At the same time, though, he stipulated: ‘within this training it shall be remembered that the bottom line of German population politics, which aims for maximization of the East, will not be harmed’.<a name="footnote19"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark19">19</a></sup><sup></sup> In practical terms, according to Gartner, neither the HJ nor the BDM (Bund Deutscher Madel) in Leipzig concerned themselves much with overseas colonial issues, and the group identity of the KJ was lost within the larger organizations. In fact, the only outward sign that members were still allowed was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petersflagge</span><span class="font2"> crest, a black, white, and red flag with the Southern Cross which was worn on the shirt pocket. Still, they met up and attended lectures, continuing an informal gathering of colonial-minded peers much like their parents had done and continued to do.<a name="footnote20"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark20">20</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:17pt;"><span class="font2">During the Second World War, KJ members were preoccupied with more immediate difficulties and did not see much of each other. Gartner, who had left school in 1937 to begin training as a nurse, joined the Labour Service. As this was one of the few career choices that her authoritarian father allowed her to pursue, she saw it as ‘a chance to free oneself a bit’. She led her own camp in the Erzgebirge Mountains, today on the border of eastern Germany and the Czech Republic, and was then transferred to Austria, where you could build up something culturally’.<a name="footnote21"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark21">21</a></sup><sup></sup> Gartner started up kindergartens, organized food resources, and planned cultural events for the local population. Perhaps for reasons similar to those that motivated the women who were sent to colonize the East or the former colonies in Africa, Gartner tried to establish a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deutschtum</span><span class="font2"> in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anschluss </span><span class="font2">territories.<a name="footnote22"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark22">22</a></sup><sup></sup> She does not see her actions as politically motivated but seems to have inherited her fascination with the foreign and the ideology of creating Germanness abroad from her father.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Gartner’s private decision to take up a cultural ‘mission in Austria during the war reflects a general shift that channelled the public memory of colonialism into more vague goals of imperialism that were not immediately connected to the former colonies. Germany’s defeat in the Second World War marks another caesura not only in public, but also in private memory. For the colonial actors’ generation, if they were still alive, it was another blow to nationalist ideology, which they found difficult to bear. Impending military defeat caused Friedrich von Lindequist to commit suicide with his wife in 1945;<a name="footnote23"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark23">23</a></sup><sup></sup> perhaps similar reasons motivated Jesko von Puttkamer to take his own life after an earlier period of military defeat in 1917. The decolonized generation thus experienced a very tangible form of loss from the Second World War which was added on to the more ideological sense of loss they experienced during the interwar period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">In families where the Second World War still left colonial actors alive, we see the incredible resilience with which they hung on to their colonial dream despite continued defeat. One might say, however, that private dreams had changed their shape by this time. It is not clear whether Heinrich Meyer still believed that Germany could regain its former colonies after the Second World War. In any case, he soon rekindled the old colonial networks and founded the Traditionsverband ehemaliger Schutz-und Uberseetruppen in 1956. His daughter, now married to a man she had met in the Displaced Persons Camp, was at his side. To her, the mission of the Traditionsverband was ‘less the reclaiming of the colonies, but rather to create a credible version of German history, particularly in regard to the colonies’. The colonial society, in its new form, was at its beginnings more or less a meeting of friends </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Kameradentrefferif</span><span class="font2">In the 1950s, for example, members living in the more affluent West Germany sent aid packages to families who had been displaced from the East. It was not until after Meyer had resigned as head of the establishment that it drafted a formal constitution and became an official philanthropic organization.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Gartner became increasingly involved in the Traditionsverband, especially following her own retirement. Keeping the memory of the former colonies alive became for her a kind of life work. The meetings of the Traditionsverband are, to borrow Homi Bhabhas term, performative’ ways of memorializing the German nation abroad.<a name="footnote24"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark24">24</a></sup><sup> <a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#bookmark25">25</a></sup>&nbsp;Meetings, still held today, are accompanied by lectures, slideshows, exhibitions, and an antique books market, all of which accord to one particular historical view: that Germany was a ‘good’ colonial power, one that was wronged by the Treaty of Versailles. In a literal sense, two members re-performed the past at the annual meeting in 2007 by dressing up in an old </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe</span><span class="font2"> and marine officer uniforms. For Gartner, this was for a long time the closest she could come to her father’s dream of moving to Southwest Africa.<a name="footnote26"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark26">26</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Others in the decolonized generation came into much closer contact with the former colonies. They formed the second wave of ‘colonial-like’ actors, colonialists without colonies who emigrated mosdy to Southwest Africa and Tanganyika Territory during the interwar period. Having a colonial ancestor was not a prerequisite for these travellers, as they were still able to construct their own narratives of life abroad as much as the previous generation had done. Much like the colonial generation itself, the decolonized memorialized their experiences with photographs, diaries, and indigenous artefacts brought back home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Max-Diedrich Gaudchau, for example, took a Woermann steamer to East Africa in 1929. At twenty-two years old, he had completed a university education in agriculture up to the first set of exams, as well as several internships. He started out at a work placement on a coffee plantation belonging to the Usambara Gesellschaft, a company that had benefited from the lifting of the property holding ban for Germans in Tanganyika Territory in 1925. Gaudchau then met an English big game hunter and joined him on safaris across the country, collecting trophies. He settled in Moshi on his return and began a hunting safari business, catering mostly for British tourists. In 1934, he had amassed enough capital to start his own coffee plantation at the Weru-Weru River. At the outbreak of war in 1939, he was interned in Dar es Salaam, where he applied for permission to return to Germany with his family. Permission was granted, and in 1940, Gaudchau, his wife and three children returned to a war-torn Europe.<a name="footnote27"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">27</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">Although Gaudchau spent only eleven years in Africa, this experience seems to have become a primary element of his identity. Throughout the 1950s, Gaudchau wrote stories and articles about life in Tanganyika, some of which were published in a book series for children, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Das neue Universum. </span><span class="font2">Gaudchau also shared photographs of animals, landscape, locals, and his daily life in Africa with his family. A comment in one of his articles shows that Africa continued to be a dream for the former hunter even after his return to Europe. Nostalgically, he writes still in the early 1950s that, when we hear of East Africa, we usually think of our former German East Africa’, and:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 13pt;"><span class="font1">The further opening of Tanganyika Territory by Europeans can certainly be done for the benefit and advantage of the Negro and is of inestimable value for our crowded Europe. The precondition for this is the cooperation between whites and blacks, which is at the moment lacking.<a name="footnote28"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark28">28</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">Thus Gaudchau, like others in the decolonized generation, internalized a feeling of loss regarding the former colonies and developed it into hopes for the future. In fact, his reference to an overpopulated Europe’ again calls up the popular novelist Hans Grimm’s vision of Africa as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Raum ohne Volk</span><span class="font2"> for a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Volk ohne Raum.</span><span class="font2"> He also mentions that such a future would depend on greater interracial cooperation than existed during his time, thus consciously taking a step to distance himself from the accusations of mistreatment of blacks that were levelled at the Germans at the end of the First World War. Although they changed somewhat, then, Gaudchau’s story shows that dreams for a German presence in the former colonies did not stop with the end of the Second World War. Indeed, holding on to the memory of the former colony was a way for the former coffee planter to place his hope in future generations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">The other primary promoter of the Gaudchaus’s memories of Africa besides Max-Diedrich was his wife. Erika Gaudchau collected her husband’s published and unpublished stories and photographs and compiled them in a family album for their nieces and nephews. While the first half of the album is composed solely of Max-Diedrich’s hunting stories and pictures of lions, rhinos, safari tents, and Masai warriors, the latter half is composed of his unpublished manuscripts and photographs of domestic life in Tanganyika. While the stories in the first half revolve around big game hunters and their powerful prey, a story in the second part is told from the perspective of two children, Barbel and Rosel. The overall impression the reader gets is of an easy, carefree life in paradise. Consider a passage from ‘Plantation Children in East Africa’:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 13pt;"><span class="font1">In the mornings, everything gathers to collect its share of that which nature provides in such abundance here. They are all satisfied—even the humans, and it is only rarely that humans make use of weapons in order to defend their culture. Whatever was needed for the kitchen was killed in the near bush or steppe and not on the plantation.<a name="footnote29"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark29">29</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">The children’s memories of life in interwar Germany, in contrast, are described thus:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 13pt;"><span class="font1">The memory of the horrible time in Germany has already faded. The flight, the misery in the camps, the adversity then in the crowded city flat, and all the worries of that time are almost all forgotten; but when the parents say that the children must now go to Germany for a few years after all, then they are sad.<a name="footnote30"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark30">30</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">Not only from a child’s perspective, the ‘freedom’ and plenty in Africa would seem preferable to life in the overcrowded, grey Germany.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">This sort of paradisiacal vision of life in East Africa is compounded by the pictures of tranquil domestic life in the second half of the album, a sharp contrast to the more violently charged photographs of virile men and their prey in the first half. Unlike the pictures of men on safari, these photos are situated largely in domestic spaces, either inside the home or the ‘tamed’ wilderness immediately surrounding it. Yet they are in their own way not entirely unthreatening. The interior shots show these spaces to be interesting amalgams of German and African people and objects. The image of a woman reading in a typically German living room, for example, is punctuated by a ferocious open-mouthed lion skin sharing the floor with an oriental rug, and an oriental or North African pouf next to the settee (Fig. 6.1).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">A similar mixing of cultural references can be seen in exterior photographs taken around the farm (Fig. 6.2). We see, for example, Max-Diedrich and a woman (probably either his wife or his sister) having coffee on the veranda. The table is once again decked out with a white tablecloth and</span></p>

The woman is clad in a checked </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dirndl,</span><span class="font2"> the typical German folk dress. Even the reference to the meal—afternoon coffee, which like the British afternoon tea is often expanded into elaborate social occasions such as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kaffeeklatsch</span><span class="font2">—speaks of the very ‘Germanness’ of the situation. At the same time, the photographer chose to frame this idyllic scene with a wilderness of tropical plants in the foreground, which appear to encroach upon the couple. Clear signs of African exoticism, these plants at once situate the German domestic scene in Africa and threaten it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Nowhere is this sense of an encroaching wilderness clearer than in a photograph of a young girl in a playpen gazing out across the lawn next to the house (Fig. 6.3). The little girl is veritably dwarfed by the surrounding vegetation: palms, vines, and flowers. Like the viewer, she seems to gaze into it in awe, threatened by it but also protected from it by a sort of wooden cage. In fact, this photograph can be read as a metaphor for the experience of many Germans in Africa, even beyond the colonial period: they were at once eager to venture out into the unknown and the exotic, yet at the same time surrounded themselves with artefacts of German culture which they used as ideological or moral protection against going native’, which was of course frowned upon by polite society at home and abroad. These photographs also illustrate the point mentioned earlier in Max-Diedrich Gaudchau’s writings on Tanganyika in the 1950s: that the Germans in the</span></p>

Because they were part of a lost past, scenes from ‘ordinary’ life in Africa gained new meaning for the decolonized generation; they suddenly became extraordinary and worth keeping and handing down to the next generation. On another level, the depictions of domestic life tempered the more violent images of life in Tanganyika at</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">the beginning of the album with what were on the whole more tranquil visions. They show children rather than wild beasts, domestic servants rather than hunters, living rooms rather than open plains. In fact, they show an ideal of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heimat</span><span class="font2"> abroad, a successful re-creation of German cultural life in a completely different setting. Since upkeep of the domestic sphere was still seen as womens responsibility, the latter half of the album may be seen as Erika’s way of celebrating women’s contributions to German colonialism in Africa. Together, these domestically situated images convey a general image of the ‘harmlessness’ of the Gaudchaus’ participation in the colonial-like project. The change of focus from the role of a single man to the role the entire family played in performing ‘Germanness’ in Tanganyika firmly embeds these episodes in family history.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">This redirection of focus begs the question of who controlled the memory of the Gaudchau family’s life in Africa. Certainly, Max-Diedrich wrote the stories and took the photographs in the album, yet it is Erika who arranged them in a narrative so that future generations could make sense of them. We see the same pattern in the Meyer family: Heinrich Meyer saved his impressions of life as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppler,</span><span class="font2"> while his daughter organized them, typing up and editing his journal for her younger relations. In other literature, family albums, in fact, have generally been seen to be managed by women, who function as self-appointed archivists’.<a name="footnote32"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark32">32</a></sup><sup></sup> Both cases also confirm recent research by historians showing that women’s memories, for example, of the Second World War, are more linked to personal and domestic experience than those of men.<a name="footnote33"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark33">33</a></sup><sup></sup> Rather than re-emphasizing a rigid division allotting cultural’ memory to males and communicative’ memory to females,<a name="footnote34"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark34">34</a></sup><sup> </sup>though, these examples suggest a different perspective. In family narratives of the decolonized generation as a whole, men were traditionally seen as the history makers, while women acted as the history keepers. In the Gaudchaus’ case in particular, Erika’s compilation of the album and inclusion of domestic photographs serves to legitimize the family’s pseudo-colonial presence in East Africa to future generations. As Patricia Holland has observed: ‘Making and preserving the family snapshot is an act of faith in the future.’<a name="footnote35"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark35">35</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">In the Trotha family, also, it is Hans-Dietrich von Trotha’s daughters who perpetuate his memory by contributing several anecdotes about his life in Africa to the family archive. They were born in 1922 and 1925, respectively, and could be grouped with the postcolonial generation because of their age. However, it is more appropriate to count them among the decolonized; firstly, because their parents were direct colonial actors and, secondly, because, unlike most postcolonials, they were born in Southwest Africa themselves. Hans-Dietrich von Trotha was a nephew of the more famous General Lothar and followed his uncle and brother to Southwest Africa in 1909. According to his daughters, he was a passionate hunter and therefore it was ‘only understandable that he was enticed by Africa’. Yet Hans-Dietrich did not come to Africa as a hunter, but as a soldier in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe.</span><span class="font2"> After enlisting in the local regiment, he became a farm apprentice and eventually acquired his own property, as many </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppler</span><span class="font2"> like him did. When the First World War broke out, Hans-Dietrich again immediately joined the ranks. During a three-year sojourn in Germany to recover from malaria, he was a member of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heimatbund</span><span class="font2"> in East Prussia, controlling weapons stores and making sure that farms and rural estates were protected from fire. His devotion to the military and to his country are thus beyond doubt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Yet the anecdotes that his daughters share in the pages of the family archive have little to do with fighting with or killing other men; rather, they show the more benevolent, quirky, even heroic side of their father. The first anecdote, which is indeed set in a military theatre, tells how Hans-Dietrich saved the life of a British soldier during the First World War in Southwest Africa. After bandaging the enemy’s wounds and giving him his water bottle, Hans-Dietrich left the British man to his own devices. This act of kindness supposedly later earned him the right to shoot an elephant, a privilege closely regulated under the Mandate government and one which usually required a special licence.<a name="footnote36"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark36">36</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">Other anecdotes included in the family archive concern Hans-Dietrich’s exploits in the mid-1920s. Like Heinrich Meyer, Hans-Dietrich von Trotha spent his time in Germany following the First World War giving lectures and showing slideshows about Southwest Africa. Because he found such a positive response, he decided to lead a film expedition from the Waterberg to the Caprivi, a region which had supposedly never before been crossed by a white man (or woman, for that matter). Two travelling companions left Hans-Dietrich during the safari, fearful of the challenges, wild animals, and violent ‘natives’ who were supposedly living in the area. According to his daughters:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 14pt;"><span class="font1">One day they [the natives’] were indeed there, surrounding his automobile, and their demeanour did not bode well. Hans-Dietrich pulled a large black, white, and red flag out of a trunk and covered his car with it. The joyous exclamations of the blacks knew no bounds. In the deepest jungle, the Germans were known and respected; Hans-Dietrich knew no other explanation.<a name="footnote37"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark37">37</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">What ties these three memories together is a theme of adventure, bravery, patriotism, and respect. Hans-Dietrich is portrayed as someone who gets himself into scrapes but always finds a way out due to his superior skills as soldier, explorer, or hunter. His courage even earns him the respect of adversaries, whether British soldiers or black tribesmen. The stories particularly celebrate Trotha’s adventurous male spirit. Although Hans-Dietrich’s two wives are mentioned fondly, they are mentioned only briefly. This is not to say that they were never talked about, but tales of their exploits were not deemed important enough to be included in the written family archive.<a name="footnote38"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark38">38</a></sup><sup> </sup>Indeed, the tales of Hans-Dietrich’s adventures valorize German virility abroad, a virility that was challenged by defeat in the First World War, but in these stories returns to the scene of the battle (the former colonies) ready for another fight—this time, in cultural terms, i.e., through the camera. In the context of the interwar period, von Trotha’s submission of the natives’ through the brandishing of the German flag could only be read as a response guided by the Africans’ fond memories for a golden age’ of German colonial rule. Such an interpretation seems to have been readily appropriated by his daughters. It is important to note that such private stories of allegiance to Germany by former colonial subjects start in this generation, as we will see how they continue and change in the next.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">As the previous examples have shown, family memory of colonialism in the decolonized generation was largely a memory of loss, but also contained within it the seed of hope for the future. This hope ranged from campaigns for outright political restitution of the former colonies to Germany, to the recreation of colonial-like settings in homes abroad, to cultural repossession of colonial spaces through travel. There remained in this generation a strong sense that Germany had unfinished business in Africa, that its civilizing mission’ had been interrupted prematurely, and that Germans needed to be able to return to reclaim what was often described in terms of a lost paradise. Feelings of loss in regard to the former colonies were thus not sentiments of defeat; quite the opposite—they were a challenge for the future.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Indeed, the memory of the decolonized generation is driven by a rich collection of stories about the resilience, patriotism, and bravery of its colonial parents’. This is enforced by material artefacts such as photographs, diaries, or ethnographic objects usually acquired by male family members and organized reverently in some form of family archive by their wives, sisters, or daughters. Finally, the decolonized generation actively engaged in nurturing a memory of colonialism in both formal and informal social networks of former colonial actors and their families. A sort of extended family sharing a passion for Africa and other overseas territories, these groups are perhaps the most obvious nodes of intersection between private, family memories of colonialism that were shared in their circles, and public memories that they shared with a wider audience through slide shows and lectures during the interwar period and beyond. Connections to such a ‘living memory’ of colonialism appear to have sparked a genuine interest in other cultures in the decolonized generation, while at the same time this interest was intricately bound together with a need to assert a sense of Germanness in the face of such ‘otherness’. Fascinated by the stories of colonialism told to them by their parent generation, the decolonized generation often redirected their inherited sentiments of loss into patriotic fervour abroad: whether in the former colonies or in other parts of what appeared to be a reclaimed and flourishing German Empire.</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 13pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">RECONSIDERING FAMILY MEMORY IN THE POSTCOLONIAL GENERATION</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">The postcolonial generation inherited considerably less in terms of both material objects and oral forms of colonial memory from its parents. This is partly due to their being removed from colonial actors by a further twenty to thirty years, but mostly because of the major rupture that the Second World War wrought in family histories. A number of the families involved in German colonialism were well-established Prussian military families who had resided on estates in the Eastern borderlands. In the course of the Russian advance in 1945, family members were forced to leave their homes and whatever belongings they could not carry with them, taking part in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ostvertreibung,</span><span class="font2"> the trek into western Germany. In terms of collecting artefacts of material culture, then, these families have very little left. Also in terms of memory, the more recent memory of the Second World War, in which this generation participated actively, and the fate of their immediate family in the conflict obviously have a firmer grip on family memories than their more distant colonial relations do. Inevitably, interviews starting with a discussion of German colonialism in this generation led to discussions of the war or anecdotes about losing relatives and having to leave the family’s property behind.<a name="footnote39"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark39">39</a></sup><sup></sup> Still, some very important memories of colonialism survived.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">When questioned about colonial actors in their family, members of the postcolonial generation resort to the family archive, which many of them are today responsible for maintaining. In formerly aristocratic families, this archive may date back to the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries, while in middle-class families it takes the form of more unofficial albums assembled or reassembled for generations to come.<a name="footnote40"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark40">40</a></sup><sup></sup> The bulk of colonial family memory at the postcolonial generation stage is contained in photographs. Flat, easily transportable, reproducible—and in recent years easily scannable and accessible to the entire family through genealogy software—these objects of memory were some of the only artefacts that could survive war, migration, and dislocation.<a name="footnote41"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark41">41</a></sup><sup></sup> They serve as a bridge connecting family memory following the rupture of the Second World War with prewar memories of colonial actors. Whether their ancestor was a colonial governor or a nurse, members of the postcolonial generation can identify with them readily through their portrait in the family archive. Indeed, this portrait is often a gateway into a more elaborate network of memories of the colonial ancestor, memories which set him or her apart from some of the more usual’ life stories of the rest of the family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Carola von Clausewitz, for example, was a Red Cross nurse who, together with another German couple, founded a hospital in Tanga with her inheritance during or shortly after the First World War. In 1939 she returned to Germany for a short respite, telling her family that she longed to see snow and eat cherries just one more time. She returned to East Africa in June of that year, whereupon the co-founders of the hospital went back to Germany for their holiday. Their visit was interrupted by the beginning of the Second World War, and they were unable to return to Tanga. So Carola von Clausewitz ran the hospital on her own until she was interned and transferred to the women’s internment camp in Mafeking, Rhodesia. In 1947 she was deported back to Germany, and subsequent appeals for a return to Tanganyika Territory were denied by the British government.<a name="footnote42"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark42">42</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">As Julia Hirsch has highlighted in her study of family photographs, the photographic family portrait draws on the style of Renaissance portraiture, its composition and various elements all pointing to what distinguishing characteristics of the sitter were worth recording in order to identify them.<a name="footnote43"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark43">43</a></sup><sup></sup> A photograph of Carola von Clausewitz kept in the family archive shows this in practice: it is a rather formal portrait of a young woman wearing a Red Cross uniform and a pith helmet (Fig. 6.4).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">The frontality of the pose, which gives the photograph a sort of rigidness, acts, as Pierre Bourdieu has noted, as a visual device emphasizing the value of the object (or indeed the person) being photographed. It is a means of offering a controlled image of oneself to the viewer.<a name="footnote44"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark44">44</a></sup><sup></sup> In this composition, the pith helmet functions as a visual cue to Aunt Carola’s’ otherness’, an anomaly in what is otherwise a typical posed portrait made for sharing and collecting in albums. It is at once a sign of colonial authority and tropical exoticism’ that made this photo worth keeping. As Kurt-Albrecht von Kessel said in our interview: ‘Here is a photograph that</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">I found in my archive—I mean, somewhere there is in the files one of Aunt Carola as an old lady, but that isn’t as interesting.

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Not only the photograph of Carola von Clausewitz, but also five photographs of Elisabeth Moller (nee von Kessel) kept in the family archive allude to the latter’s connection with Africa. All these photographs draw on an iconography of colonialism that was established over decades since before the beginning of the German colonial project, an iconography which includes tropical clothing, guns, wild animals, and lush vegetation. Many of these elements, of course, also have paradisiacal connotations. Depicted either as wearing a pith helmet, with hunting trophies, or</span></p>

</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">with her paintings of the Southwest African landscape, Elisabeth Moller, as remembered by future generations, is also inextricably linked with an exotic identity, a unique non-European aura. The visual cues of colonialism typically used in portraits therefore make the subject instantly recognizable as the ‘colonialist’ in the family. Returning to the model of Renaissance portraiture described earlier, the portrait again demonstrates how material accessories become an important means of identity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Moreover, some photos of Elisabeth Moller conform to a tradition of photography associated with the ritual of colonial hunting, which throughout the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries had portrayed the hunter as a ‘manly adventurer and hero of Empire’.<a name="footnote46"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark46">46</a></sup><sup></sup> Elisabeth Moller adopts this conventionally ‘male’ pose of hunter and prey in Fig. 6.5. Although it may at first seem unconventional, the photograph draws on wider public conventions of imagery, all of which connote a sense of freedom, particularly for women. The short trousers hint at relaxed constraints for women’s dress (at least for sports activities); the gun and the trophies suggest a primeval sort of self-sufficiency (based on the ability to procure meat); the outdoor setting reveals a great extent of physical mobility. Presumably this picture was kept in the family archive precisely because it fulfilled the expectations of its viewers, who were brought up to believe that the former colonies were sites of freedom, adventure, and self-sufficiency for men and women. As Patricia Holland has remarked, pictures which match up to expectations give enormous pleasure, pardy because their familiar structure is able to contain the tension between the longed-for ideal and the ambivalence of lived experience’.<a name="footnote47"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark47">47</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Narratives of colonial memory within German families present not just a link with an other, often exotic world overseas, but also with ‘otherness’ within the family. In each family interviewed for this chapter, the family member’s connection with the colonies defined their identity and almost always guaranteed them a position as the most well-known (though not necessarily the most talked-about) figure in the family. Ancestors could be identified with a colonial aura in straightforward ways such as nicknames: for example, according to Claus von Wissmann, his ancestor Hermann von Wissmann is only ever known as ‘the Afrika-Wissmann within the family.<a name="footnote48"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark48">48</a></sup><sup></sup> Such an exotic aura also manifests itself in the material objects inherited from these relatives, objects displaced from their original surroundings and still serving as mnemonic devices for a family history of colonialism to the postcolonial generation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">In the context of museum exhibitions displaying artefacts of German history, the art historian Dedef Hoffmann has alerted museologists to the danger of auratization </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Auratisierung)</span><span class="font2"> caused by exhibiting objects with a ‘halo’ of electric light. An object displayed publicly ‘surreptitiously becomes a symbol for a greater reality: ‘it is charged, no longer standing simply for itself and its own history, but also for an episodic or event complex’.<a name="footnote49"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark49">49</a></sup><sup></sup> But do privately owned objects of colonialism have the same effect? Although they are not always exhibited as elaborately as in a museum display, evidence suggests that material objects from the colonial past also undergo a process of ‘auratization in which the object stands for a family narrative of colonialism. They assume a special place within family histories, but at the same time they have become too much a part of everyday life for the postcolonial generation to be called ‘reliquaries’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Kurt-Albrecht von Kessel, for example, remembers a gift he received from his ‘exotic godmother’ Carola for his christening: gold cufflinks that had been fashioned in East Africa, engraved on the one side with cloves and on the other with cardamom.<sup>50</sup> In Bettina von Kiigelgen’s family, a book bound in zebra hide contains photographs of life in East Africa and short stories written by her uncle, the previously mentioned Max-Diedrich Gaudchau, in the 1930s. Kiigelgen has also kept over the years a wooden elephant with real ivory tusks that her mother brought back with her when she visited her brother abroad. The elephant was always kept in the front hall, along with other colonial ‘trophies’, immediately signalling to visitors the family’s connection to the former colonies.<sup>51</sup> Fragments of material culture thus signal ‘otherness’, a uniqueness already embraced and determined by their original owners, at the same time as they are valued as very personal sensory reminders of relatives over the years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 24pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">The postcolonial generation remembers its colonialist and colonial-like ancestors not only as unique, but also often as harmlessly quirky characters within the family. Claus von Wissmann told me how his relative crossed through the Congo Basin on behalf of Leopold II riding a tamed ox.<sup>52</sup> Olof von Lindequist said his ancestor is most often talked about in his family in regard to his introduction of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">karakuls</span><span class="font2"> (Persian lambs) into Southwest Africa.<sup>53</sup> Ewald and Nikolaus von Puttkamer showed me a photograph of the vast mansion that their relative Jesko von Puttkamer had built in the middle of the jungle.<sup>54</sup> And although fully aware of the negative legacy of Lothar von Trotha, even Clamor von Trotha dug out a letter showing Lothar von Trotha’s penchant for ornithology from the depths of the family archive.

<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:10pt;"><span class="font0"><sup>54</sup> Interview with Ewald and Nikolaus von Puttkamer, Ulm, 3 May 2007. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trothae.<a name="footnote50"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark50">50</a></sup><sup></sup></span><span class="font2"> This initial private snapshot’ of memory is thus often strikingly different from the public one in contemporary history books.</span></p></li></ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">A further aspect of these colonial actors’ supposedly ‘harmless’ and good-natured character is that most are remembered as having particularly positive relationships with indigenous Africans. Carola von Clausewitz, according to her nephew, spoke fluent Swahili and trekked across East Africa from one farm to the next in order to inoculate European and African workers alike against diseases.<a name="footnote51"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark51">51</a></sup><sup></sup> Bettina von Kiigelgen was told by her mother that her uncle ‘never oppressed’ his black farm workers and indeed got along extremely well with them.<a name="footnote52"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark52">52</a></sup><sup></sup> Although Jesko von Puttkamer may have had a sexual relationship with an indigenous Cameroonian woman resulting in an illegitimate child, in oral family history, he is said to have at least paid for the child’s schooling.<a name="footnote53"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark53">53</a></sup><sup></sup> Such stories ‘proving’ colonial ancestors’ benign relations with indigenous communities are told by the postcolonial generation not because of their own need to justify their family members’ actions overseas (although this may also be true), but mainly because these stories are the memories they were told by their parents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:14pt;"><span class="font2">Positive relationships with Africans also take centre stage in anecdotes that circulate or circulated in public discourse, but have been internalized by former colonial families and are now told by the postcolonial generation almost as if they were private memory. Claus von Wissmann related an anecdote he had heard from friends about a German official visiting the former colony Togo ‘long after’ the Germans had left. Supposedly, a former Togolese soldier, having been told that there was a German official present, saluted him and yelled, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">'Halt’s Maul!’</span><span class="font2"> (‘Shut up!’).<a name="footnote54"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark54">54</a></sup><sup></sup> Kurt-Albrecht von Kessel recalls a similar story told among his parents’ generation: ‘There’s a good story from Togo... where after the Second World War there were people doing construction work in the jungle. There was a clearing and the parrots were still singing, “Forward March!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Marsch! Marsch!\</span><span class="font2"> and “Halt!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[Stillgestanden!\</span><span class="font2">. They learned that from the drill ground that used to be there.’<a name="footnote55"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark55">55</a></sup><sup></sup> In this story, as in Wissmann’s anecdote, the memory of Germany’s colonial occupation is seen as continuing in the former colonies even after it faded from public memory in Germany itself. Such memories, tightly bound with images of military authority, speak fondly of Germany’s military past, a kind of golden age of worldwide presence before total defeat at the end of the Second World War.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">This is a characteristic which is not particularly German, however. Indeed, Elizabeth Buettner has shown how exactly the same process occurred among Anglo-Indian families who returned to England following decolonization. As in German family memories of colonialism, British memories also involved simple domestic life and amiable relations with Indian servants. Happy childhood-inspired memories of colonialism among the colonialist class, Buettner argues, are one of the main factors responsible for creating a largely positive, nostalgic meta-narrative of British colonialism today.<a name="footnote56"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark56">56</a></sup><sup></sup> Two important differences are that the British experience of decolonization and formation of colonial memory occurred around thirty years after the Germans first had to face their colonial losses, and that the British were not forcibly decolonized. What has kept positive German colonial family memories from becoming the dominant public paradigm was the experience of the Second World War and 1968, and the subsequent public taboo placed on all notions of a German empire, whether continental or overseas.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Still, among some interviewees, there was a logical progression from humorous anecdotes—or other commonly known ‘facts’ about the legacy of a German presence in the former colonies—to conclusions about German colonialism having been a ‘positive’ event in its history. Thus the memory of loss and the need for justification of Germany’s colonial acts was carried through from the decolonized to the postcolonial generation. Although it was challenged by a younger generation during ‘1968’ and its confrontation with the imperial past, in the end, it is still seen to a great extent in a positive light by the postcolonial generation. This is precisely because of humorous privately told anecdotes concerning colonial actors themselves, as well as the loyalty of former subjects in a military context.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">In general, there was a need amongst interviewees in the postcolonial generation to solidify colonialism as either a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ event in German history. Such essentialization is anchored in the labelling of specific colonial personalities that have, within the lifespan of the postcolonial generation, gained a reputation as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ colonialists through newspaper articles, television documentaries, and monuments, and, to some extent, by historians. The negative extreme of this spectrum is the persona of Lothar von Trotha, the general in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe</span><span class="font2"> who ordered the extermination of the Herero in the 1904-8 war in Southwest Africa. The positive extreme is Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, commander of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Schutztruppe</span><span class="font2"> in German East Africa during the First World War, who entangled British and South African forces in an enduring guerrilla fight and refused to surrender until November 1918. A historiography of Lettow-Vorbeck’s positively connoted image can be seen as reaching its peak during the Weimar Republic and extending into the early 1960s, when he was given a state funeral in Hamburg. Lothar von Trotha’s image, by contrast, lingered in the background before it reached its peak during the 1960s. There are thus at least two layers of public memory, embodied in these two figures, to be considered when untangling the family memory of colonialism in the ‘postcolonial generation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font2">Built up over decades, the public memory of these two colonial actors has become so internalized in the postcolonial generation that it determined much of their answers to questions in interviews, at least at the beginning. Responses to an initial query about colonial memory in these families were often constructed in order to position the family in a ‘good’ history of German colonialism. Although to some extent this is a natural instinct to preserve family honour, arguably the initial impulse by the postcolonials to present a positive image of colonial family members is also due to the fact that this generation was heavily influenced by official memory culture propagated under the National Socialists. The Nazi cult of male heroism and colonial revisionist aims picked up on colonial enthusiasm from the Weimar period, a combination of the exotic and the patriotic, and maximized it in colonial propaganda. As described in Chapter 3, the Nazis’ take on colonialism revolved around military men who were seen as Germany’s past heroes and inspirations for future ‘imperialists’. Key figures from the German colonial memory, such as the explorer Carl Peters, were revived, as Nazi propaganda attempted to erase any negative connotations and paint them in a positive light.<a name="footnote57"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark57">57</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font2">It seems that colonial propaganda under the Nazi regime, whether propagated by whole-hearted National Socialists or members of former colonial organizations who had been subsumed in the Nazi bureaucracy,<a name="footnote58"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark58">58</a></sup><sup> </sup>was highly effective on youngsters who were at least one generation removed from any negative public stories of colonialism that had surfaced during the colonial period itself. Kurt-Albrecht von Kessel, for example, born in 1926, remembers reading a lot of colonial adventure stories as a boy. Not only through literature, but also through games and other forms of popular culture, Kessel and his contemporaries were enthused by the military prowess of colonial ‘heroes’ such as Gustav Nachtigal, colonial pioneer in Togo and Kamerun. Kessel also remembers singing the tune </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Heia Safari</span><span class="font2"> as a member of the Hitler Youth, a memory so vivid that he can still recite some of the words.<a name="footnote59"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark59">59</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">The song was initially written in 1921 by Alfred Aschenborn in commemoration of General von Lettow-Vorbeck’s military campaign in German East Africa, but found its way into numerous editions of music collections throughout the next fifty years and beyond. The tune, which is perhaps most well-known in the postcolonial generation, is also familiar to the decolonized and extra-colonials. It has become an aspect of German popular culture repeated so often that it has become decontextualized, separated from its imperialist origins through the generations. The first stanza runs as follows:</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 118pt;"><span class="font1">How often we have marched On narrow Negro paths Through the middle of the steppes On the break of dawn</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 0pt 118pt;"><span class="font1">How we listened to the sound</span></p>
<p style="padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 118pt;"><span class="font1">Of that old trusted song Of the bearers and askari Heia heia safari!<a name="footnote60"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">60</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="font2">The song highlights the most important elements that have come to build a ‘Lettow-Vorbeck myth’, or a positively charged narrative, of German colonialism over time: German military ingenuity, guerrilla warfare, adventure, immersion in the African wilderness, and, most importantly, the loyalty of black soldiers.<a name="footnote61"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark61">61</a></sup><sup></sup> As children, Kessel and his friends were fascinated by this version of colonial history: ‘Of course, as a boy I ran around in the park with a rifle over my shoulder and played “Askari”... colonial history was something really cool for us.’<a name="footnote62"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark62">62</a></sup><sup></sup> The infiltration of colonial memory into popular culture was apparently an effective way for the Nazis to rally support around the colonial revisionist cause at the most basic level, and one that is not easily forgotten in this generation because it is so bound up with childhood adventures and play.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">Claus von Wissmann, born 1923, also remembers details from the glorified image of colonialism presented to the public during the Nazi era, but in a different form, one geared towards attracting children and adults alike. Wissmann recalls that ‘in the time of National Socialism, Nachtigal, Peters, Liideritz, no, Lettow-Vorbeck und Wissmann were honoured in a series of stamps; so the colonial system was remembered’.<a name="footnote63"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark63">63</a></sup><sup> </sup>The people Wissmann remembers on the stamp collection are clearly those men whom he sees as the most celebrated colonial heroes. Interestingly, he first includes Liideritz, but then corrects himself and substitutes Lettow-Vorbeck. In fact, the man depicted in the collection produced in the Colonial Memorial Year 1934 is not Lettow-Vorbeck, but Adolf Liideritz, the German entrepreneur who in 1892 laid claim to a strip of coastal territory around Angra Pequena, today Liideritzbucht in Namibia. Wissmann’s response once again shows how dominant the memory of Lettow-Vorbeck is to his generation—more dominant, in fact, than the memory of the ‘founding fathers’ of German territory overseas is the memory of the man who purportedly defended them to the bitter end. Rather than remembering the stamp collection as it really was, then, Wissmann’s response reveals a more general trend in the position of the colonies in the collective memory of this generation. It is a socially structured pattern of recall that shows how their defence and loss had a greater impact on popular consciousness to that generation than their initial acquisition did.<a name="footnote64"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark64">64</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">The external, public memory of German colonialism changed in the mid-1960s, a moment when the focus was shifted to ‘bad’ colonial actors, although for a time both images could coexist in public space, with competing groups (and generations) offering contending ‘memories’ of colonialism. At the same time, in private realms of memory in the postcolonial generation, the negative image of Lothar von Trotha and his cohorts seems to have reinforced a positive image of Lettow-Vorbeck through juxtaposition. This opposition draws a convenient moral line in collective memory between German actions in Southwest Africa and colonial practices in German East Africa. Set against the backdrop of the ‘bad’ Trotha, Lettow-Vorbeck’s mission in East Africa appears all the more positive. Interviewees in the postcolonial generation, holding a range of opinions about colonialism in general, appear to agree on the relatively positive effect of German colonialism in East Africa. Many even seem to regret the negative view of colonialism that they see as taking over public memory in the media.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font2">One interviewee claimed that he ‘knows’ from anecdotes that Germans were very concerned about the well-being of the indigenous population in East Africa.<a name="footnote65"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark65">65</a></sup><sup></sup> Putting aside any consideration of whether or not there is any truth in such a statement, it is perhaps no coincidence that such an opinion is held in a contemporary context where the German—Hereto War in Southwest Africa has been declared a genocide, and families of victims have sought compensation, while the Maji-Maji War in East Africa has received comparatively little public attention. Another interviewee attempted to draw a line between ‘ordinary’ farmers and government officials involved in colonialism, allocating responsibility to officials giving orders from above, rather than ‘ordinary people’ on the ground.<a name="footnote66"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark66">66</a></sup><sup></sup> Her reasoning here appears to be very similar to this generation’s way of ‘coming to terms’ with Nazism and the Holocaust. It was not until historical studies such as those by Daniel Goldhagen and Christopher Browning were published—Goldhagen’s account amid considerable controversy—that a historical focus shifted to Nazism’s ‘ordinary perpetrators and collaborators. This paradigmatic shift may have occurred too late to be internalized fully by the older members of the postcolonial generation. A theme of having to ‘follow orders’—brought to the fore by the trial of Adolf Eichmann and famously challenged by Hannah Arendt in the early 1960s<a name="footnote67"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark67">67</a></sup><sup></sup>—recurs in this generation, which still sees German colonialism primarily as a military and occasionally an economic undertaking. So, even as public memory since the mid-1960s challenged the image of Germans as good, but misunderstood colonizers, in internalized public memory found in families that were involved in colonialism, a figure like Lothar von Trotha becomes the aberration, and the ‘myth’ of Lettow-Vorbeck and his ‘loyal askari’ the norm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:16pt;"><span class="font2">Although private memory of family members may be influenced by public memory of German colonialism, interviews showed that ultimately, the private, internal family memory, if it exists, has more authority than public memory. Usually, the authority of the private is taken as understood within the family circle and not exposed, but in some cases, a dissonance leads to the appearance of private memory on the public stage, and a contestation of collective </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">memories</span><span class="font2"> ensues. This is the case with the memory of the explorer in East Africa, Hermann von Wissmann.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">Claus von Wissmann began our interview by showing me an article that had appeared in the local newspaper only a few weeks earlier. The article labels Hermann von Wissmann as</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:1pt;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 14pt;"><span class="font1">one of the most controversial German colonial heroes’. The officer ravaged bloodily in Bagamayo and Dar es Salaam under the pretext of the anti-slavery campaign. As commissar of the Reich Wissmann achieved dubious fame, and his racist and brutal actions led to the Maji-Maji war in 1905, which claimed between 75,000 and 300,000 African victims.<a name="footnote68"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark68">68</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding:0pt 0pt 7pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">It cannot be historically verified that Wissmann’s actions of the 1890s led directly to the Maji-Maji uprising. Indeed, the factors involved are usually seen by historians to be indigenous groups’, and especially peasants’, reaction to taxes; forced labour, especially in the cotton industry; the violent behaviour of local colonial agents, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">akidas',</span><span class="font2"> the discipline of missionary schools; other uprisings in the region; competition with the colonial government over natural resources; and their general subaltern status in the German colonial system.<a name="footnote69"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark69">69</a></sup><sup></sup> But Claus von Wissmann was focusing on something else. Showing me the article, he told me: ‘Yes, yes, they mentioned him, but they mentioned him incorrectly—they portrayed him as racist and bloodthirsty, which he wasn’t, because he was the first governor who fought against the slave trade.’<a name="footnote70"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark70">70</a></sup><sup></sup> In response to the article, Claus von Wissmann wrote a letter to the editor. In it, he lists Hermann von Wissmann’s ‘achievements’ in Africa, including the crossing of the continent from West to East (‘as the first European), the exploration of the Congo for the Belgian King Leopold II, and his campaign against the slave trade, which led him to be appointed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reichskommissar</span><span class="font2"> by Bismarck in 1889.<a name="footnote71"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark71">71</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;"><span class="font2">He then goes on to cite a letter written by his cousin, Hermann von Wissmann’s son, to the president of the University of Hamburg, a letter written in 1967 in the midst of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Denkmalsturz</span><span class="font2"> movement that attempted to topple Hermann von Wissmann’s statue from its plinth. In our conversation, Claus von Wissmann moved directly from Wissmann’s misrepresentation to the anecdote also mentioned in his cousin’s letter. According to the Wissmanns, when the president of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, went on his first state visit to Europe, he was asked by a German television reporter why he had chosen West Germany as his first stop. As Claus von Wissmann explained, Nyerere responded: ‘that went without saying, for after all, his tribe had sworn to be blood brothers with the Africa-Wissmann—that is how strong memory is’.<a name="footnote72"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark72">72</a></sup><sup></sup> In fact, Claus von Wissmann told me that Nyerere for years tried to get the statue of Wissmann back to Dar es Salaam, its original location. Looking back at Wissmann’s own travel accounts, however, we find that the story of blood brotherhood was a myth constructed by Wissmann himself. Other sources say that in a different situation, Wissmann had ordered two of his officers to become blood brothers with the Warussa, but never did so himself.<a name="footnote73"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark73">73</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent:15pt;padding:0pt 0pt 33pt 0pt;"><span class="font2">These anecdotes again show the centrality of positive African memories of German colonial occupation to German families involved in colonialism. They also demonstrate how, to Claus von Wissmann’s generation, private family memory, the memory as related by a cousin (Hermann von Wissmann’s son), is still viewed as having greater authority than the public memory represented in the newspaper article. Although the original anecdote relates to public information—the reporter’s interview with Nyerere in the 1960s—it can be seen as having been internalized and ‘authorized’ by Hermann von Wissmann’s son. In the case of the 2007 newspaper article, though, the discrepancy between private and public memories was considered so great that Claus von Wissmann thought the public needed to be ‘reminded’ of the ‘correct’ memory. This is of course one way of ‘coming to terms’ with a colonial past.</span></p>
