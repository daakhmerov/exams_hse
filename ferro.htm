<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5">‘White history’, a vestige: Johannesburg</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">‘White’ history is moribund; but the ‘whites’ ’ history is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Selecting systematically the school textbooks of several European nations, Roy Preiswerk and Dominique Perrot have made up a record of the stereotypes underlying this ‘white’ history, the principles behind its periodization, the principal values stressed by the whites in comparison with the rest of the world - respect for law and order, national unity, sense of organization, monotheism, democracy, settlement, industrialization, the march of progress, etc. Much of the same can be found in every European country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, during the last half-century this type of history has been under scrutiny. True, the very attack on it has, in a sense, been ‘white’, but, nevertheless, it is clear that the struggle for independence from the colonizing world has been the principal agent of a far-reaching revision. Against the overwhelming pressure of History in process, ‘white’ history has conceded ground; but only step by step, and in proportion to the process of decolonization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the 1950s, for example, as Denise Bouche notes for the history of Black Africa, some minor concessions were made in the school textbooks: the Toucouleurs of El Hadj Omar, who had resisted the French conquest in 1870, are no longer called ‘fanatical Moslems’; while Omar no longer ‘pillages’ the Bambouk, he ‘conquers’ it. Even in the former colonial powers, diplomatic expediency and prevailing fashions required a more considerate policy. For example, in 1980 there disappeared from the French third-form textbook, Hatier, an illustration from 1907 showing some Moroccan corpses in Casablanca: it had as its caption, ‘A street after the passage of the French.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, if in the West this sort of history is disappearing in the textbooks, it remains alive and well in the collective consciousness. There will be many opportunities to demonstrate this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yet, apart from South Africa, there no longer exists, as such, a ‘whites’ ’ history, whether in Europe or, obviously, still less intact, outside it; it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">disappearing by itself. In the extra-European world seeking to bring its cultural past back to life, there survives hardly more than a single ‘whites’ ’ history in its pristine conditions: only that which is taught in the country of apartheid, to the little white children of Johannesburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Africa of the Afrikaaner, history is not only a matter of ‘white’ origins which, in the words of Franz Fanon means ‘the history of the white man and not those whom he oppresses, rapes, plunders and murders.’ History also draws equally upon the ‘Christian’ tradition: the Bible and the rifle have always been, for the Boer, in those huge open spaces of the country, the companions of his fear and solitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A statement by the ‘Institut vuur Christelijke-nasionale Onderwijs’ (ICNO) epitomizes both the Christian and racist objectives of history teaching: it dates from 1948 and reiterates formulae or themes which had already been launched in the aftermath of the French Revolution, when J. A. de Mist, having attempted, vainly, in 1804, to laicize education, found his reforms attacked and then annulled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The instruction and education of white children must be based upon the conceptions of their parents, hence it must be founded upon the Holy Scriptures . . . love of what is our country, its language and its history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">History must be taught in the light of revelation and must be seen as the accomplishment of God’s will (Raadsplan) for the world and humanity. We believe that the Creation, the Fall and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ are historical facts of capital importance and that the life of Jesus Christ is the great turning-point in the history of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We believe that God willed separate nations, separate peoples, and gave to each its vocation, its tasks and its gifts. Our youth can only continue, in faith, the tasks of its elders if it has a knowledge of history, that is to say, a clear vision of the nation and its heritage. We believe that after our maternal language, a patriotic history of the nation is the only means by which we can love one another.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font4">From the Great Trek to Marco Polo</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The fundamental event in Afrikaaner history, apart from the arrival of the first colonists, is the Great Trek of 1838. The Great Trek was the decision of an entire people to migrate across the country, in search of a land of refuge from the English, who had been masters of the Cape since 1815.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Boers therefore wanted to maintain their beliefs, keep Afrikaans as the official language, maintain their traditional way of life and their</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘traditional’ modes of relations with the blacks, which the English intended to reform by giving to the Hottentots an equal status to those of the whites:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was contrary to the law of God and opposed to the natural differences of race and religion. For every good Christian such a humiliation was intolerable: that is why we have preferred to separate ourselves in order to preserve our doctrines in all their purity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This conception of the relations between blacks and whites was written in the constitution of the first Afrikaaner Republic of Transvaal, founded in 1858: ‘There will be no question of equality between Whites and non-Whites, whether in the Church or within the State.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the Boers, the Great Trek, this Anabasis of several years, was, in the words of Marianne Cornevin, the precise equivalent of the Exodus of Moses, the search for the Promised Land. Its route is sacred and so are the dates and places through which it passed, such as the day on which Andries Pretorious made his call to the Almighty, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Geloftedag, </span><span class="font3">when the Boer people contracted their pact with God. Inspired by this oath, they carried off a brilliant victory against the Zulus, at Blood River, and thirty years later the Boers restored the camp </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(laager)</span><span class="font3"> which had sheltered them during the battle. Later on they also restored the place where, in 1880, they fought their first war of independence against the English, who wanted to lay their hands on Transvaal: the late Lord Milner, who appreciated the symbolic significance of such objects, had had most of the place thrown into the Indian Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus these places, these stones and objects made up the triumphal stages of Afrikaaner history; in the children’s history books there is a whole chapter given over to cataloguing them. This is a unique example. History in South Africa is as much a pilgrimage as an understanding of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The voluntary decision to depart, the Great Trek, bore witness to the will of the Boers not to be oppressed by laws and customs contrary to their convictions. This symbolism imbues the spirit of their entire history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, the very choice for the opening chapter of the history book used in the fourth form: astonishingly, it concerns none other than . . . Marco Polo. The apparent function of this chapter is to place South Africa on the great routes of the voyages of discovery. But the facts which precede this show exactly why Marco Polo turns up in this way in Johannesburg, and we become able to read this chapter in a different way, to see it as a sort of premeditation on the events that will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How would you like to leave your country at the age of 19 to go on a journey that will last 24 years?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How would you like to visit an exotic country and become very rich?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How would you like to see strange things that you’d never seen before?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our story begins a very, very long time ago, more than a thousand years before your great-grandfather was born. At that time people did not go far from the village of their birth, for it was very burdensome and very dangerous to travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were some people, however, who went on distant journeys, pilgrimages; they returned to the Sacred Places, the most popular of which, although it was also the most difficult of pilgrimages, was the Holy Land, Palestine. There, the pilgrims met Arabs who slept on mattresses, and not on straw; who had spiced foodstuffs and all sorts of luxurious objects, such as silk, velvet, carpets and perfumes. Imagine what stories these pilgrims could tell when they returned to their country. In 1071, Jerusalem, the Holy Land, was captured from the Arabs by a people of warriors called the Turks. A large number of soldiers took part in these Holy Wars, of Crusades, against the Turks, before the Crusaders, in their turn, came to know the riches of the Orient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The merchants of Europe, and above all the Italian towns of Genoa and Venice, predicted a huge demand in Europe for luxury goods, especially spices and silks. These were expensive products, for the merchants had to take great risks to get them and were often attacked by wild beasts or else by ferocious tribes, such as the Tartars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was at this time that Marco Polo left for his great voyage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Marco Polo came from Venice, which was a very strange place to live in, for it had canals in place of streets. We would find the world a very odd place at this time for there were neither cars, nor planes, or even steam-ships then and nobody had even yet heard of South Africa. Even if we found ourselves in England, we would find it very hard to understand their language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day, Marco Polo’s father and uncle, who were both merchants, left on a long business journey. As the years went by, and they failed to return, people began to believe that they had died. Nine years later, however, they suddenly reappeared in Venice and told of how they had discovered a marvellous country, called Cathay. Imagine how Marco must have marvelled when they told him of the wonders they had seen. He must have become even more excited when he learnt that Kublai Khan, the king of Cathay, had invited his father and uncle to return. Perhaps they would allow him to go with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And Marco Polo did go with them, two years later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A whole host of surprises awaited Marco Polo on his arrival in the capital of Cathay. The first was the fact that they used paper for money. Nobody had ever heard of such a use for paper in Europe, for at that time printing had still not been invented, while the Chinese had practised it for centuries. Another strange custom was the nightly curfews. Nothing was spared to make Kublai Khan’s palace the most beautiful in the world. And what wonders there were . . . ferocious animals and stables packed with thousands of white horses. Everywhere craftsmen were busy making silks and carpets; and here and there one might see an alchemist changing metal into gold or finding the elixir of life. Banquets and celebrations were continually taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After he had been some time in the capital, Khanbalik, Marco Polo was asked what he found most surprising about China. Do you know what he replied?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His reply was astonishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To Marco, who came from a country, Venice, where only one religion was practised, it was amazing to see a king who allowed his subjects to practise different religions. Amongst Kublai Khan’s subjects, there were Christians, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus and Mahommedans ....</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4">Virtues and courage of the Boers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">South Africa, land of liberty and religious </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tolerance:</span><span class="font3"> such is the first impression young children are given of this country. This introduction to history, with that reply by Marco Polo, is reinforced by other factors — the arrival of the Huguenot refugees, who escaped from Louis XIV, and of other countries’ citizens, to find liberty in South Africa. It was these free citizens who made up the nation and who, later, in their struggles against the English came to attach less importance to gold and riches, than to the more noble values of the faith .... South Africa was a land of tolerance and welcome, but she was also a daughter of necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the Turks were barring all routes to the Orient, western merchants had to look for alternative routes to Asia. Sailing down the African coast, the Portuguese became the first to reach India by the south and the west: ‘This is why our country has many ports with Portuguese names.’ But they did not stay long ‘for, conflict having broken out with the Hottentots, the king of Almeida and sixty-nine of his men were killed during a struggle to regain their ships anchored off the coast.’ From that time on, the power of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Portuguese began to decline, while the English and Dutch were beginning to exploit the same route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Up until that time, the Portuguese, who had become extremely wealthy through their trade with India, kept all its benefits to themselves, and the route to India was a closely guarded secret. The Dutch had to content themselves with retail trade. When in 1580, Philip II, King of Spain and Portugal, closed Lisbon to the Dutch, it was a devastating blow to them, for the Dutch depended upon this commerce. They were forced to seek the route to India by themselves. Hardy sailors, they thus came by our country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the death of Almeida, the Portuguese were too frightened to remain in South Africa, because of the Hottentots, and so the place became free; the Dutch thought the Hottentots might well be disposed to do a deal with them, particularly in the exchange of cattle. In spite of the mistrust of the Hottentots, they established themselves here. Some fifteen years later, in 1652, 200 Dutchmen, led by Jan van Riebeeck, founded the first permanent establishment of South Africa. This is why </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6</span><span class="font3"> April is a national holiday.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4">On the hardship of being a colonist</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Van Riebeeck was eager to establish relations with the Hottentots, who had at their disposal a large number of cattle. At the beginning only a few berry-gatherers came to visit the colonists. One of them was called Herry, and it was through him that barter was established with the Hottentot tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">13 April. A cow and a plate are swopped for three copper plates, and a copper chain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">6 June. Disease is becoming rampant. Out of 113 men, only sixty are capable of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4 September. The first peas and carrots come through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Van Riebeeck’s men were discontented; they had been working hard and did not have enough to eat. One night, four of them tried to escape. But they came back and were punished with two year’s work in the mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unfortunately, the Hottentots were becoming equally mistrustful. They were giving cattle in exchange for various objects, and then coming back to steal back the cattle. Herry was no longer reliable. And then one day, all the cattle were found missing. There was so little food that the colonists were forced to eat monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Hottentots stole cows and sheep. They reclaimed the areas which the Company had reserved and burnt all the pasture lands</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">in protest. In order to solve the problem, Van Riebeeck built a wooden fence as a border; just as the Dutch had taken their cattle, the Hottentots now complained that they had taken their land. The quarrels did not stop. And finally a war broke out; the Hottentots lost the land which they had occupied near the Cape. As for the colonists, they now complained at no longer being able to do business with the Hottentots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to provide the colonists with workers, after the Hottentots, Van Riebeeck decided to introduce slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">28 March 1658. One hundred and seventy slaves arrive from Angola. Most of them are ill and die en route. The remainder are girls or young boys who would be useless for the next four or five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">17 April. The Company buys a building from a Portuguese merchant in order to establish a school for the young slaves. To encourage the slaves to become Christians, they are given a little glass of brandy and two pinches of tobacco after every sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Introducing these slaves to the Cape colony was a great mistake. The colonists tended to leave them with the most difficult tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The young colonists were no longer able to carry out the craftsmen’s skills since there were slaves to do this work. But the importation of slaves helped towards the development of the colony. It was the labour of slaves which built most of the beautiful farms of our country ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mentzel, who visited South Africa at the beginning of the eighteenth century, described the mores of the period. The Colonists and the administrators of the Company would call upon each other, to be offered wine or tea, a slave would offer round a pipe with a spill to light it. There was no social barrier preventing a colonist from marrying a member of the Company, no more than there was one between the most humble soldier and a girl of the highest birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides private slaves, who tended the fields and carried the produce to market, there were hundreds of slaves belonging to the Company, who were boarded in a special building. Unfortunately, these slaves were not very well treated; the law was strict and punishments harsh. Slaves would be hanged in public if they stole. Governor Tulbagh mitigated the laws concerning slaves; nevertheless they remained harsh. He showed his humanitarian sentiments by the way in which he treated his own slaves who were liberated on his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This ‘idyllic’ era came to an end with the Batavian Republic, which, being a ‘fraternal republic’ in the French system, sought to secularize</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">'white history', a vestige: Johannesburg </span><span class="font3">institutions; the land was changed completely with the annexation of South Africa by Great Britain after the Congress of Vienna (1815).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Boer colonist was now colonized by England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Measures taken by the crown as regards the blacks caused, as noted above, the Great Trek of 1838, the establishment of the Boers beyond the River Orange, and then the foundation of the Republic of Transvaal in 1852. These events went together with the destruction of the Xhosa and of the Zulu kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Twenty years later, the discovery of diamonds and gold in the Transvaal asserted an irresistible pull upon fortune-hunters, and one of them, Cecil Rhodes, was able to associate the government of Queen Victoria with his conquering endeavours. Attempts by the English to appropriate Transvaal caused several wars between the Boers and the British, who finally won in 1902. South Africa became a Dominion whose independence was recognized in 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Boers, henceforth called Afrikaaners, were once more dominant and once more asserted their idea of apartheid. The Bantus were settled in the ‘Homelands’ or territorial units with frontiers defined by Pretoria.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4">The problem of the black homelands and the justification for apartheid</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In history as taught to children, just as in ‘white’ memory itself, the Bantus are supposed to have left the Great Lakes and Central Africa for South Africa while the whites were moving north. The blacks were crushed as the Boers moved northwards so that the Voortrekers are made out to have taken empty and ownerless lands after the massacres inflicted by the Zulus and the Matabele.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Trek Commissioners, sent out as scouts in 1834 to gather information on the region beyond the Orange River, sent back altogether favourable reports about the fertility of the soil and the quality of the pasture-land. It also appeared that the lands were </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">practically</span><span class="font3"> void of inhabitants, since the natives had been massacred by the Zulus and the Matabele while all the survivors had hidden themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus, in a sense, the whites’ arrival saved the blacks from extermination ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Trekkers managed to destroy the power of the Zulus and the Matabele. This resulted not only in the opening out of territory to white people, but also in the end of the terrible wars which had devastated the country and destroyed all the smaller tribes. Thus,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">without realizing it,</span><span class="font3"> the Trekkers had saved the small tribes from annihilation by suppressing the power of those who had hitherto persecuted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The italics are mine and show how school-books are more subtle than politician’s speeches. The peremptory claim is that whites and blacks arrived at the same time over the Orange, for this gives them the rights of co-occupation. Marianne Cornevin has no prejudice as regards the legitimacy or effectiveness of this statement, but she has shown that, in fact, it is mythological. She refutes these assertions one by one, drawing upon the anthropological and archeological works of the last fifteen years. These give evidence of the original occupation of the Transvaal area by the Bantus and their dispersal after the civil wars and the wars with the Anglo-Boers. They show that the present distribution of the Black Homelands is a result of the political force which expelled the blacks from the best land. It is thus wholly false to suggest, as the white version has it, that they now live within their original tribal territories.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font4">A good racist conscience</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">How would you like to live with people who never wash themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How would you like to wear nothing more than a loin cloth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How would you like to spend your life in the desert and never go to school?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know why foreign scholars and students are more interested in Bushmen than they are in the other white people who inhabit this country? Because the Bushmen of today are at the same stage of development as the Europeans were thousands of years ago. Studying the Bushmen helps us to discover how our ancestors lived when they were still in the Stone Age ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Master hunters, disguising themselves as ostriches, imitating the cry of birds, tirelessly chasing hares across the fields, they end up by crushing the animal that falls into their hands. They also use poisoned arrows, following the tracks of an animal, stocking water in ostrich eggs, and sucking the liquid from vegetable plants with little pipes. An arrow stuck into the ground marks a Bushman’s supply of water and it is forbidden for others to tamper with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day a Bushman was invited to visit the Cape; he was shown all the wonderful inventions of the city. When he was asked what had impressed him most, he pointed to a tap. That one might turn water on at will seemed to him the most extraordinary thing of all • • • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bushman have strange ideas about religion. They have a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">number of gods, among them the moon, the rain and even the praying mantis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They do not raise cattle as they have not yet reached this stage of development. When they see cattle belonging to white people or the Bantus, they hunt them as though they were wild animals. The owners naturally want to protect their cattle and therefore many Bushmen get killed. At one stage they were becoming so destructive that they had to be chased out like vermin. They were simply unable to understand that the animals belonged to other people, and because of this they were almost totally eliminated as a race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And here are the questions asked in the exercises at the end of the chapter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What stage of evolution have the Hottentots reached?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Answer: the stage of development)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In what way do they resemble the Bushmen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(in their methods of hunting)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Which animals do they farm today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(sheep and goats)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why do they throw their witch-doctors into cold water?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(to exorcize them when they have cast an evil spell)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What does the word Hottentot mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(it comes from the Dutch </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Huttentut^</span><span class="font3"> meaning stammerer) Name four tribal groups who share Hottentot blood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(the Korana, Griquas, Orlam and Cape-Coloured).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These questions typify both the biological and racist vision of a white history, that only South Africa perpetuates openly. But it was a history that was glorified, not so long ago, in the works of the great ‘colonizing nations’. Dominique Maingueneau has examined the school-books of the Third Republic, showing, through a strictly linguistic analysis, that hierarchical gradation of races and peoples is one of the founding principles of these textbooks, whether </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Tour de France par deux enfants </span><span class="font3">(published for the first time in 1877, frequently republished up to 1914, and successfully reprinted very recently), or in geography and history books. P. Foncin’s geography book, for instance, says in the chapter on African races that Bushmen were ‘undeveloped beyond a pre-tribal stage . . . given over* to a gross fetishism . . . and are small and uglier than monkeys. . . .’ Using a wide variety of criteria, such works can be seen to have drawn up a hierarchy of peoples - depending on activity, habitat, social organization, etc. The Arabs, Berbers and Moors are placed at the top of the hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unconnected to the history of South Africa, but immediately following, come several chapters on general history which complete the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">third-form work. These chapters concern the progress of civilization and technology from ancient Egypt to the jet-engine. To place South Africa within the context of the broad history of the West is vital, for the general approach, as we have seen, is the vision of the colonists, the history of the colonists by those who experienced it, and shaped it. This is a long way from the same history seen from Europe, that is to say, a manifestation of the expansion of Europe and the early phase of imperialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On this point, as will be shown later, the Africans adopt the traditional perspective of history seen from Europe - though, as it were, in the reverse. The same problem recurs, even if the facts are not exactly comparable, with the Arabs’ and the Israelis’ versions of the Palestine conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But it is the last chapter of the South African work that, for us, is most strange. It gives a detailed list of the historical sites of the Afri-kaaner’s Africa, the fifty places upon which the citizen must walk in order to base his roots more firmly in a country whose ownership might be challenged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A comparable phenomenon can only be found in the USA and in Canada, although no real threat exists there, the Indians having been either penned into reservations or annihilated. Pilgrimages will impregnate citizens with a country in which they have only existed for a few generations. The experience of ‘history with the feet’ is an exercise in symbolic exorcism.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4">Credo Mutwa: black counter-history</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The Bantu tradition offers a radically different version. A witch-doctor, Credo Mutwa, gathered together several strands of history from his grandfather and from more distant relatives. ‘These are the stories that the Elders tell to boys and girls, sitting open-mouthed around the fire at night - children whose faces are not yet marked by the life to come.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Credo knows the white history. He contests not so much its accuracy, as its blind shamelessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ‘superstitions’ which are supposed to be so strange, are mentioned to show the Africans as inferiors. But suppose that a pig were let into a mosque at Dar-es-Salaam or that the effigy of the Virgin in a Sicilian procession were defiled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For want of education, Credo argues, Bantus are still quite often ignorant of the kind of technical discoveries that have been made: they tend not to live near telegraph poles for fear that they might transmit conversations to the police; and the mechanics of photography or of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">'white history', a vestige: Johannesburg </span><span class="font3">finger-printing seem to hide the secrets of strange procedures, known only to the white man. But the Bantus and Bushmen also have a knowledge that the white man could never possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Long before the Europeans, they knew how the solar system worked, and they knew nature better than the whites who had lost contact with it. They also had an elaborate code of laws, of which the Portuguese and Dutch not only did not even know the existence, but could not even have imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From this point of view, the Kaffir wars have a quite different explanation from the white one. The most difficult to defeat had been the Xhosas, a fine nation which existed long before the Zulus, which had emigrated southwards after the destruction of the Munumutaba empire. They had mixed with the Hottentots and the Bechuanas. Unlike the Zulus, they fought from close range, not from a distance, as they had failed to devise proper javelins; they made mass use of knobkerries, eschewing shields altogether and they had developed the art of using a sling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Their speciality was cattle-thieving, for which they made use of ancestral talents and practises; but, like the Masai of Kenya, they did this more out of pleasure than need, and decorated the beast afterwards until it was hardly recognizable. However, in Xhosa law, it is just as legitimate for the thief to be robbed, as it is for he himself to rob. The Xhosas were perfectionists and stole in ever more refined ways, it being understood that his victim might do the same back to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In bartering, the Xhosa and the Portuguese or Dutch did not follow the same customs. For example, they accused the Xhosa of stealing when the latter, succumbing to temptation, were merely taking a gift on their departure, according to the Xhosa custom; ‘had the Europeans not taken food when they came to feast with them?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Above all, the English and Dutch did not know, on the eve of the Kaffir wars, that a cow cannot be bartered for material objects, even large quantities of metal or tobacco. The accepted practice in bartering was to give back one of a cow’s offspring. In this way the whites were surprised that they had managed to dupe the Xhosa so easily that he had given away his cow, whereas the beast was only a sort of pledge in exchange for another deal at the same time, by which, several months later, the calf could be given back in the form of one or two other beasts. The colonists, not understanding the terms of the exchange, were more than a little surprised then, when, having dealt in hundreds of beasts, they found them disappearing after the supposed exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Credo Mutwa blames the authors of these white textbooks, such as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">J. C. Johns, for not taking the trouble to analyse the different conceptions of law held by the Dutch on the one hand and the Xhosa on the other, treating the latter as ‘superstitious people who did not understand the meaning of a treaty.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True, a knowledge of the mores and customs of the Xhosa may not always be to their advantage. George Grey learnt this in the nineteenth century. Knowing their beliefs as to the need for ‘respite’ between two wars, he appreciated that the Xhosa would not attack the European settlements in the seven years following their defeat, unless a particular revelation incited them to. He managed to trick them into thinking there was such a Revelation and that their Gods were inciting them into a sort of collective suicide. In this way, without having to run the risk of renewed war, a part of the Xhosa community disappeared, by suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The testimony of Credo Mutwa is not unique. There are efforts to create a Black History in South Africa, especially since the rest of Africa has become independent and the Soweto massacres have stirred international opinion against the racist practices of the Pretoria government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This ‘black history’ contests the explanation of the past that (as Marianne Cornevin showed) legitimized the tribalization of natives and their dispersal to the arbitrarily-defined ‘Homelands’, creating a moral and historical base for apartheid, while justifying the limited extent of the black ‘Homeland’ areas. As we know, in spite of their increasingly pressing and confident demands for the future, the blacks themselves have little opportunity, at least within the territory of South Africa itself, to affect the Whites’ History, and to change its contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Black History can only be written outside South Africa.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5">‘Decolonized History’: Black Africa</span></h3>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4">The stratification of history in Black Africa</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In Black Africa, knowledge of history is the outcome of a three-fold stratification. The oldest, oral tradition, works not only at the level of fact but also on that of myth - the legend of a Chaka, or of a Soundiata has as much reality as their real exploits, while a Torodo could identify with both the acts and the legend of El-Hadj-Omar. The second stratum is the history taught by the colonists. Finally, since independence, the work of African historians and today’s Africanists has resulted in a general, and still evolving, reevaluation of African history: their conclusions are expressed, for instance, in the journal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Afrika Zamani</span><span class="font3"> and its results may be seen in the various new school-books of French-speaking Africa. They offer a ‘decolonized history’.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4">From history to legend: Chaka, king of the Zulus</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">In African memory, the adventures of the Zulu kingdom, strengthened by Chaka (1816-28) is today a mixture of legend and historical fact. Black-African literature, particularly in its French variant, has taken up this theme and given it a new function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chaka was a warrior of astonishing bravery, and he betrayed the king who would not install him as successor: he told the enemy where the king meant to fight a battle. Once his king had been captured, Chaka took his title and guaranteed Zulu supremacy over the Mtehtwas (1816). Almost immediately, he began to modernize military methods and reorganized the army, to which he gave Spartan training. Firstly, he changed the shape of the throwing spears which the Zulus traditionally made long so that they would travel further; he replaced them with shorter assegais, which could be used only in hand-to-hand combat. To train the Zulus, he developed physical exercises to strengthen the muscles of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">fighters whom he put upon an increased meat diet. He encouraged their training by introducing tests where he allowed the competitive spirit full sway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those successful in battle were offered nubile young women, the most beautiful at the king’s disposal. The women, too, had been initiated to the ways of combat; and Chaka had them train where his bright-eyed warriors might see them. However, until the tests they were forbidden to have the slightest contact with the women, or even to touch them, on pain of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Circumcision ceremonies had already been abolished amongst the Zulus, and so enemies no longer benefitted from the collective convalescence periods, when they could attack a tribe deprived of the support of its youngest men. With Chaka ‘sexual energies were diverted from their reproductive functions and turned into a motor for war.’ (Randles)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After twelve years of Chaka’s rule, in 1828, a section of the army became tired of the military and administrative tyranny (which made the Zulu kingdom a great military empire which even the whites did not dare to challenge), rose in rebellion and assassinated Chaka.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whether through impotence, homosexuality or morbid fear of ageing, Chaka left no descendants. His successors dismantled his military empire, whose power, nevertheless, continued to worry the Dutch and the English. During the Great Trek, the Boers pushed the Zulus back towards Natal after the victory at Blood River. Fifty years later, the English decided to subdue them further. Having suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Zulus, during which the prince imperial, son of Napoleon III, was killed, they finally destroyed the Zulu army on 4 July 1879; thus ended the empire of the Men from the Sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is an historical reconstruction. In the Zulu memory and, above all, beyond the frontiers of ‘South Africa’, Chaka’s life represents another reality, half-way between myth and legend. This has more reality than History.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chaka was, for some, black Jesus Christ, and for others the symbol of negritude; his adventurous life has clearly been transfigured by the oral and written tradition. To begin with, there is the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Chaka</span><span class="font3"> of Thomas Mofolo, a black epic written by a religious Bantu, the Sesotho original of which remained for many years buried in a cupboard of the Missionaries of the Evangelical Society of Paris. His hero triumphs with the assistance of the Devil, and there are a thousand crimes, extortions and similar cruelties, before Chaka dies in a plot hatched by his brothers. In other versions, Chaka kills a leopard at nineteen, defeats the witchdoctors, locks an enemy queen alone into a hut with a ravenous hyena. From a hard core of 500 men, he builds an invincible army which, according to another tradition, soon swells to 400,000 and is destined to govern the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the myth was soon strengthened as against Mofolo’s version. Praise replaces blame in Izibongo; with Nenekhaly-Camare’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Amazoulou,</span><span class="font3"> Chaka becomes a collector of land, and so the symbol for African unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the poems of L. S. Senghor, and the plays of Badian and A. A. Ka, Chaka was soon to be an object of increasing honour; he lived beyond death, or, rather, submitted to death, which would be a liberation, provided his work of resurrecting African power were understood by the Africans whose history he had begun. If for the Christian Mafolo, Chaka’s death symbolized the defeat of evil, now it meant the heroic sacrifice of a man who was the founding-father of a true African state. Once he was dead, the whites were free to enslave Africa and so his death meant the End.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We’ll be turned into the slaves of the white man. The empire of the Men from the Sky will go under another name, South Africa. And our Gods will allow this to happen. Our intellectuals will whistle in the wind. Our priests will turn a blind eye. And so our brothers will beat us to death for a fistful of rice. Treated worse than dogs, we will even be barred from walking in the streets. Any foreign tear for our misery will soon be dried by the lure of diamonds. All protestation will be powerless. We will become the greatest martyrs of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Amazoulou,</span><span class="font3"> Act III)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4">The role of the earlier past</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">As regards the more distant past, for instance amongst the Agni of the Ivory Coast, African historical learning ‘does not occupy, as it tends to do in Europe, a role of its own’. It is not a particular branch of knowledge, but is intimately linked to social conscience and is recalled at ceremonies such as the wakes and yam-feasts, etc. History thus comes to life in such vital moments of social existence, although access to it is governed by strict rules, and since it is an ancestral matter, only specific holy men may touch it, and even then only at specific times, such as these ceremonies. Since history involves transfer of political power, its content is ‘shaped according to power’ and is thus presented in a bowdlerized version. It is no easier to talk of ancestors’ lives and achievements than to name them. Their virtues and exploits can be celebrated. But defeats and errors are concealed; wars are always won and sovereigns are always exemplary. In a general sense; ‘this past is a model and the present only a pale reflection of it.’ The memory of history is kept alive as a sort of reservoir, in which the Agni people can find inspiration</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and precedents: at the coronation of the king the list of his ancestors is read out and ‘he is given good advice’, according to a precise ritual, accompanied by a model reading that might show no weakness or hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This past goes back to the time of the exodus, that is, the period when the Agni settled in their present-day lands. It ends with the colonial conquest, while the period of colonial rule is given little emphasis -individuals are free to remember as they like and memories are not codified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Claude Perrot relates one of these historical narratives of the precolonial period, which she learned from Nana Alou Mea, chief of the Kouadiokouro. It concerns the origins of the system of chiefs in Indiene and demonstrates how far the desire to glorify the system’s origins can be a matter of vital concern for the present-day power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Indiene three men count as safohenes (military chiefs). In the political hierarchy they came immediately below the king. The origins of two of these chiefships conform to the official version, for in all the variants of the exodus-story, their ancestors played a great part, equal to the king’s, or his ancestors’. But the third of these chiefships is another matter - the official story conforms to the original model, but the spoken tradition varies from village to village. The founding ancestor of the third of these chiefs was not from the exodus, but from the succeeding generation, becoming rich through trade, with Gwa and the Cape Coast, and gold-mining. Money gave him a hereditary kingship, whereas usually the contrary occurred, in that royal promotion gave wealth. That is ‘how the world was given to him’, i.e. how he became a safohene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The office of the third military chief was not earned through bravery in war, according to custom, but by services rendered. However, that ran contrary to custom and the ancient values; the Agni could not admit such origins, which did not figure in the official tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The origins of power is therefore a story which admits variations and this is also true of the dynastic tables. Those of Indiene have ten names after Ahi Baye, who was king at the time of the Exodus; and yet Claude Perrot notes that with new discoveries the non-official list amounts to seventeen kings, in the right order of succession. The names of at least four kings are unsung - some of them, unlucky heroes of the wars with European conquerors, others, victims of fate or an accident. ‘A true king can be neither beaten, nor taken prisoner.’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4">The second level: ‘our ancestors, the Gauls’</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">This phrase figures among the best-known ludicrous stereotypes of French colonization in Black Africa. It may be a legend. Literally</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">speaking it certainly is, to judge from the careful work of Denise Bouche on education in Senegal from 1817 to 1960. In the early days only European children went to school, particularly at St Louis, where the teachers were brothers of Ploermel or sisters of the Immaculate Conception. Now, whether white or among the first blacks admitted to the schools, the children of the early nineteenth century did not run the risk of hearing about Gallic crudities, for at this time the French nation had not really discovered the Gauls as ancestors. Notions of history came from various lessons concerning church history and the first kings. French history was cut into centuries and reigns and began with Phara-mond, whom we now know to be an invention, and ended with Charles the Bald or Saint Louis. Teachers seldom reached the Bourbons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the Bourbons were there in spirit. By 1898, the Director, Garri-gues, was accusing the Senegalese public schools of teaching exactly the same subjects as in France. ‘We could surely at least omit the murder of Clotaire and the baptism of Clovis’. He also thought ‘that there is something objectionable about revealing, through history, the mistakes we made before arriving at the stage of civilization we have attained.’ There were some efforts to include a little African geography and history, but they had only a very limited role and even that was reluctantly concerned. The colonists did not like the natives to have an education. However, George Hardy, the inspector-general of French West Africa, was an advocate of universal education, and he stressed the beneficial effects that such schooling might provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not so much a history of France that we are proposing, as an historical view of French power to counteract the tendentious and all too often, anti-French history of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">marabouts</span><span class="font3"> and above all the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">griots</span><span class="font3"> which presents the French victory as temporary and owing to accidental causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The history that was taught to children was communicated not just in history lessons but affected the whole of school work. In his book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Le Chant a 1’ecole indigene - (Hymn to the Native School)</span><span class="font3"> George Hardy extolled industriousness, thrift and the other French virtues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pour que notre Afrique soit riche,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ami, mettons-nous au travail, au travail . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Au lieu de dormir ou causer, allons, Allons debroussailler la terre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Avant d’inviter parents at voisins,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Payons nos impots, acquittons nos dettes, Mettons de cote quelques sacs de grains, Nous pourrons alors chanter a tue-tete . . . Salut, France, et gloire a ton nom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nous t’aimons comme notre mere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Car c’est a toi que nous devons,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">La fin de toutes nos miseres. . . .*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was natural, especially given the origins of primary and secondary teaching staff, that, as schools spread, instruction of the metropolitan type should accompany it, even though there were several books written for the schools on the history and geography of Senegal. ‘In Senegal’, wrote the Englishman, Mumford, ‘apart from the colour of his skin, the Negro of French culture is French in every respect.’ The definition of the ‘Union Fran^aise’ in 1946 implied assimilation and the turning of Africans into Frenchmen. The spirit of equality which prevailed, at least in the administration which, from the rue Oudinot in Paris dealt with Africa, led to the introduction of the Metropolitan curriculum for schools at all levels and in all subjects. In history, it was only then that the Gauls really turned up. From now on history meant, for all in primary education, the history of France; in secondary schools it was history from classical times to the European era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘The colonist makes history’, wrote Franz Fanon, ‘and he knows that he is doing so because here he is the agent of the mothercountry; the history which he writes is not that of the plundered country, but the history of his nation as it loots, rapes and famishes.’ Senegal does not figure, except in its submission, and then its regeneration through French colonialism. This was true everywhere in the French empire, for it incarnated the progress of history and civilization. When, in 1948, in a junior class at Oran, I began my lesson with a general view of the course, and told forty </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pieds-Noirs</span><span class="font3"> children that after the fall of the Roman empire and the barbarian kingdoms Arab civilization took over, the whole class burst out laughing. ‘Arab’ and ‘civilization’ did not go together. . . .</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4">The testimony of a young Senegalese woman, Sow Ndeye</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">What has Sow Ndeye retained of this history? She was twelve years old when Senegal gained its independence, and was in the first form of a school catering mostly for white children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">History, for her, was essentially the Romans, the life of those Roman children whom she imagined, bathing and going to the theatre or the circus. She also remembered the Gauls, their green and leafy country,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">* For an Africa to be rich/Let us get to work my friends/Enough of sleep and gossip/Let us start to clear the land/Before giving parties for family and friends/We’ll pay our taxes and our debts/Let us get aside some sacks of grain/And then we can go and sing/‘Hail France and glory to you/We love you as our mother/For to you we owe so much/The end of our poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">with four well demarcated seasons, so different from Senegal. She could picture this refreshing and wonderful past under the sun of Provence: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Au Pays bleu</span><span class="font3"> was her first reader, with pictures relating to Greece and Rome. And then there was Charlemagne, who founded his school, Louis XIV who built those extraordinary gardens and those palaces. Such is the area within which her idea of the past operates: neither her native country nor Africa interferes with it. It is only much later that they come on the scene for, as her teacher says, their history was not ‘interesting’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no embarrassment or shame, but the history of Africa left only two faint traces. Firstly, she remembers Moussa, wife of Kankan, king of Mali, who went on a pilgrimage to Mecca and, while crossing the desert, she felt a sudden desire to bathe. Her servants soon dug out a basin in the sand. Her other memory is of the bloodthirsty Samory; he had the foetus of his servants pounded in a mortar specially made for this end. No, African history was not likely to nourish Sow Ndeye’s imagination. History and her dreams were elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first wound, hardly healed twenty years later, came one day in the fifth form, during a lesson on the great invasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the Goths [said the teacher] the Ostrogoths and then the Franks flooded into Gaul; then came Islam, the Moslem invaders, who were from Africa and passed from Spain into Gaul; but luckily they did not succeed in conquering it and Charles Martel stopped them; they had to retreat and then were chased, first from Gaul, and then later from Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That ‘luckily’ pierced Sow Ndeye’s heart like a dagger. She whispered her anguish to her neighbour who, like her, was black and Moslem. The wound healed slowly. She revived later when the French teacher had her read a poem by Bernard Dadie, ‘Je vous remercie, mon Dieu, de m’avoir cree noir.’ - A tear ran down her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And from that point on the tie was established within her between the fight for independence, the struggles of Abd El Krim and the effort to reevalue African culture. ‘Black is beautiful’, sang Sow Ndeye’s girlfriends; she tried out the dresses and hair-styles of the past and looked at history for the sources of her identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Black Africa today, this search tends to exclude even those historians or film-makers who are well disposed towards the African past. ‘A stay of twenty years is not enough to know us’, says Sow Ndeye. Behind her secretive smile, I sensed that ultimately she thought that the foreigner, having conquered, plundered, exploited, still wanted to deprive her of the pitiable remains of her secret identity, and to lay her open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only the ancient past cannot be talked of, for it has been codified. The more recent past, still fresh in the memory, does not have the same status, and may be freely discussed. So it is the colonial conquest which</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">African memory still recalls, a memory which Jean Rouch has beautifully restored in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Babatou and the three Counsels.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4">The programme for decolonization</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">It has become increasingly accepted since the sixth Pan-African Congress at Dakar in 1967, and the recent works of Dart, Leakey and countless other scholars, that tropical Africa is the cradle of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the first observation made by Oumar Kane, one of the founders of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Afrika Zamani,</span><span class="font3"> the African historical review whose self-declared aim is to ‘decolonise History’. And this does not mean simply correcting its European ‘viewpoint’. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus we must stress the priority of the prehistoric African people; nearly every step forward taken by prehistoric man was first registered on African soil, particularly on the high plains of eastern and southern Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the study of prehistoric Africa, particular stress must be given to the Neolithic Revolution, based, as it was, upon agriculture and the domestication of animals. Up till now the theory of external property has prevailed in relation to the invention of agriculture and its introduction into Africa. But if the role of ancient Mesopotamia, the Fertile Crescent and the Nile cannot be denied, then why can’t we envisage the birth of agriculture in Africa independently of property? ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It appears from all the works on the subject that agriculture was adopted throughout Africa between the fourth and second millennium BC, while other areas were not affected until the second half of the first millennium BC. The most important plants for our nutrition had already been selected: millet, sorghum, yam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Particular stress must also be given to the increasing desertification of the Sahara and its consequences. This process allows us to explain the location of African peoples through history and the great migrations of shepherds, who, in search for pasture, were forced to uproot other settlers. Are the people of our savannahs anything more than the population of the Sahara during the neolithic period? Aren’t the peulh or touareg shepherds simply descendants of the Saharan shepherds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such dislocation from the plan of ‘Universal History’ implies a new periodization:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the historic period Oumar Kane suggests adopting the chronology</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of Hrbek who ‘left the beaten track of western chronology and the Marxist plan for history, which completely failed to serve the evolution of African societies.’ Hrbek proposes a chronology based upon the dynamic of African societies themselves. Its periodization would be as follows, in reverse chronological order:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 1950s: twentieth-century independence movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1890-1910: end of the period of independence that began about 1830.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1805-20: corresponding to the ‘profound reversals in the zones of contact and the isolated zones: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">jihad</span><span class="font3"> of Ousman-dan-Fodio in western Sudan; formation of Chak’s Zulu state; the rise of Buganda; foundation of modern Egypt by Mehmet-Ali; unification of Madagascar; beginnings of the Omani hegemony on the eastern coast. Generally, a tendency towards unification and monarchical absolutism; this also coincides with the abolition of the slave trade.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">End of 15th/beginning of 16th century: ‘Arrival of Europeans and introduction of American tobacco plants. Invasion of eastern Africa by Nilotic tribes (Gallas). Foundation of Kuba, Luba, Lunda; decline of Songhai and disappearance of the city-states of Haoussa, Kanem - Bornu, Wadai and the Fundj sultanate. Southern migration of the Bantu. Mediterranean Africa comes under Ottoman domination.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bantu diaspora in central and southern Africa during the iron age in Black Africa (third century BC to fifth century AD). The iron age began with the movement of Bantus from the upper Congo basin towards the southern savannahs. This development would have been connected with the introduction of vegetable plants from south-east Asia.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The spread of Islam and the foundation of the central Empires are thus relegated to a secondary level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The originality of this outline lies, as we can see, not only in its disassociation of African history from that of the Orient or Europe, but in its elimination from African history of all that might cast shadows over the present, stir up arguments, or endanger African unity and Africanism. In point of fact, the textbooks that are written for children manage to keep a relatively independent stance from these ‘recommendations’. For instance, far from relegating to a secondary level the foundation of the central empires, the extremely innovative work of M’Bow and Devisse places them right at the centre of things. To anyone brought up on history from a European perspective, this outline cannot fail to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">'DECOLONIZED HISTORY': BLACK AFRICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">be revealing, even if, at times, it stresses, to excess, the state of Africa before Europe.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4">Achievements and omissions of the new African history</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">To young Africans, the history of their continent appears as an endless procession of kingdoms and empires, each more glamorous or perfect than the last. First there is the Ghana empire, ruled by Sisse, the golden king; then there is the Mali empire, which had its greatest period of development under Mansa Moussa who</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">gave noble and generous charity. Having started out with a hundred packs of gold, he spent them all during his pilgrimage to Makkah (Mecca), first amongst the tribes which he encountered between Mali and Cairo, then in Cairo itself, and finally between Cairo and the noble Hedjaj; he spent so generously that, penniless on his return, he had to borrow from merchants under jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then comes the Songhai empire of Gao, ‘a centralized state, with advisers and ministers of protocol, justice, finance, police, navy, army and cavalry.’ The Aksia dynasty developed its culture and, in particular, founded the university of Timbuktoo ‘whose reputation went beyond the empires’s borders’ (fifteenth century). Further south the Mossi kingdoms distinguished themselves ‘by flexible precision in political organization, extraordinary social stability, and an almost total refusal of contact with the outside world.’ The Houssa cities were also stable, and yet fought amongst themselves, though it was just this democratic character which made them original. Further south, ‘the countries of the coast’ were just as famous, with the Yoruba cities and the kingdom of Benin. As for the Bantu kingdoms, which came into existence much later, they were ‘rich and peaceful’; but, apart from the Congo, they soon became victims of colonial expansion. More glorious was the fate of the Monomotapa in eastern Africa. Its wealth explains the prosperity of all that coastal region, which, through its links with India, the Arabs and China, produced a dazzling civilization, the civilization called ‘Swahili’ after the language used throughout the region. The arrival of the Portuguese ended this Swahili civilization at its apogee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the same time, the Christian West was afflicted by endless woes -the ‘insecurity’ which destroyed the Carolingian order, the break-up of states, and war. ‘Men travelled little and knew themselves less’. The renaissance came only much later, with the rise of the Dutch and the Italian cities. But as soon as Europe recovered its wealth and population, it was driven to diverse forms of expansion, the crusades and colonial conquests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus a striking parallel can be drawn between this brilliant African world and the West. This can be shown in terms suitable for the kingdom of Ghana and for the Christian West:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kingdom of Ghana</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Powerful</span><span class="font3"> empire</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Profitable</span><span class="font3"> commercial relations</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Peasants are victims of social organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Worsening conditions of the serfs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another characteristic is that the relations maintained by many black kings with Islam are rarely made explicit. If mention is made of those kings converting to Islam, and the resistance of the jungle countries, it is only in passing. Curiously enough, this is the only area where historians admit difficulties in the problems they are tackling and their own inability to resolve them, or to agree as to a satisfactory interpretation. The conditional tense and the use of ‘perhaps’ makes a sudden and singular appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One tradition which many historians consider as uncertain concerns the occupation of Ghana by the Almoravids in 1075. They are said to have forced the king to convert and massacred all those who still believed in spirits. Abou-Bakr gave the last years of his life to the fight against these pagans. He met his death in battle in an unidentified place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Perhaps</span><span class="font3"> the pressure of the Almoravids forced the animist leaders of Ghana to retreat southwards and to choose a new capital less vulnerable than Koumbi-Saleh. All these questions are very tricky and are still a subject of research and discussion amongst historians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No sooner is he forced to write about Islam, than the hand of the historian begins to tremble.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4">The Ceddo and Islam</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">How did this omission of Islam and the memory of its conquests come about? A film by Sembene Ousmane, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ceddo,</span><span class="font3"> explains the tragic context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From his own researches and the use of the oral tradition, Sembene Ousmane has brought the resistance of the Ceddo during the distant seventeenth century back to life. The Ceddo were men who disobeyed, both in the Ouolof and in the Pular states. They hankered after absolute freedom and yet corresponded neither with a particular ethnic group nor with a religion. In the film, the Ceddo have kidnapped the king’s daughter and are holding her prisoner. The Ceddo people continue to recognize the king’s authority, but demand simply that he should disband the Council of the Imams which, in the name of the Koran, was gradually taking power. Aware of his own diminishing power, but too weak to do anything about it, the king did not really condemn the kidnapping of his daughter, for he understood its significance. But he was a prisoner of the power-system which the Imams had instituted with his tacit consent, for Islam appeared to him a superior wisdom and knowledge, affirming that His Reign was above and beyond the normal reign of kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The princess, a prisoner of the Ceddo, waits for deliverance. She too is Moslem and the failure of her two brothers, killed in succession by the Ceddo, has strengthened her pride. But to her despair, her father is killed in the campaign against the insurgents, who are finally defeated. They lack weapons and have had to approach the White Man to obtain them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Once the Ceddo are defeated, the Princess’s hand in marriage is promised to the Imam. But during the wedding ceremony she seizes a weapon and kills him in front of a crowd of forced converts, who rally to her ....</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this marvellous and moving drama, the Muslim leaders felt themselves attacked; so is the white man who appears, yet again, in the figure of a priest; his only care is the ideal of a black church for all and, chasing this chimera, he is absolutely indifferent to the fate of the Ceddo, their destruction, and their will to survival.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4">The anti-Christian tradition in Swahili poetry</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">What is true in Senegal is not necessarily true for the rest of Africa; there were no ‘wars of religion’ in eastern Africa and the collective memory retains a completely different image of Islamization. Jan Knap-pert has shown this in his studies of the various styles of Swahili literature, and particularly the local poems transmitted by popular tradition. In the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Herekeli,</span><span class="font3"> the oldest of these poems, there is constant mention of the conversion of Christians and pagans. The poem began with the death of Jaafar, the cousin of Mahomet, killed by the Christians whom he was trying to convert. The Archangel Gabriel then presented himself to Mahomet, ordering him to make war on the Emperor Herekeli. ‘If you become a Moslem’, Mahomet said, ‘we’ll make a nation out of you’; which was, indeed, the specific quality of the animists’ conversion in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Herekeli)</span><span class="font3"> when the bishop received a letter, he would stamp with rage, the usual Christian reaction to the Swahili people; they were always impatient, irritable and brutal. ‘The Christians, greedy and irascible, behave like children; they don’t have the dignity or the eminence of the Moslems.’ - ‘Nonsense’, replied the bishop, ‘we worship the Little Jesus who could be the favoured child among our children.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reply had a surprising effect on the blacks who, if absolutely necessary, might accept the worship of a fully grown man, but certainly not a child. The Christians show other ridiculous eccentricities in these poems; their armies are preceded by crosses and by ornamented scrolls, which they gaze upon at the most dangerous moments of battle. The success of the Moslem cavalry over the Christian cavalry shows the will of God who gave victory to the Moslem warriors; even if they die they will still receive riches and glory. The battles of Ajnayin and Yarmouk are still celebrated by the Swahili oral tradition. Thus conversion by faith is the most usual form of conversion, even if a few have to be converted by force. It is the old method of carrot and stick. Other characteristics of the epic tradition can also be used to explain the conversions to Islam, e.g. the miracles which Mahomet accomplished and which complement practices that fill a magical universe. The cult of virility was equally important in seducing the blacks: Mahomet had nine wives and Moslem boys claimed to know the names of all of them. He had nine because, exceptional as he was, he could satisfy all of them in one night. Thus while Christianity preaches abstention and chastity, Islam teaches ‘better one wife than many, but you may have four, to forestall sin.’ The need for polygamy is thus catered for, which also, in turn, guarantees male supremacy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4">One-way slave-trade</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">As regards Islam, the same hesitancy emerges in the chapters on the slave-trade, although it is used as title for the junior textbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We call ‘slave-trade’ the commerce which tore black men from their families, sold them as slaves and transported them away, principally to America, from the end of the fifteenth century. This trade, practised by the majority of European nations, by the Americans and the Arabs, with the complicity of the African chiefs themselves, lasted until the end of the nineteenth century, and has strongly marked the history of Black Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This would be a perfectly good account if the Arab slave-trade had not started seven centuries earlier and if there had been any mention of slavery in Islamic countries (there is only a ‘reading’ taken from Louis Frank). The hand of the historian has clearly trembled yet again, once it had to write about the crimes committed by the Arabs who castrated thousands of men and deprived them of any progeny, and yet the record of crimes committed by the Europeans occupies, quite justly, whole pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us now follow these slaves, or their descendants, on the other side of the Atlantic in the West Indies, where the blacks, transplanted like the ‘Hindus’ who came from Asia in the nineteenth century, live together with Asians in Trinidad, Tobago or Jamaica, where they replaced the Caribs and Indians whom the first Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch colonists massacred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What vision of their past is offered to the descendants of these forced migrants?</span></p>
